        new. All that has been aimed at is, to bring together as many of the
        old discoveries as possible in a new dress.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
        thought well to let the records tell their story as far as possible
        in their own way, by the introduction of translations, thus breaking
        the monotony of the narrative, and also infusing into it an element
        of local colour calculated to bring the reader into touch, as it
        were, with the thoughts and feelings of the nations with whom the
        records originated. Bearing, as it does, upon the life, history, and
        legends of the ancient nations of which it treats, controversial
        matter has been avoided, and the higher criticism left altogether
        aside.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Assyriology (as
        the study of the literature and antiquities of the Babylonians and
        Assyrians is called) being a study still in the course of
        development, improvements in the renderings of the inscriptions will
        doubtless from time to time be made, and before many months have
        passed, things now obscure may have new light thrown upon them,
        necessitating the revision of such portions as may be affected
        thereby. It is intended to utilize in future editions any new
        discoveries which may come to light, and every effort will be made to
        keep the book up to date.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For shortcomings,
        whether in the text or in the translations, the author craves the
        indulgence of the reader, merely pleading the difficult and exacting
        nature of the study, and the lengthy chronological period to which
        the book refers.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A little
        explanation is probably needful upon the question of pronunciation.
        The vowels in Assyro-Babylonian should <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "pageiv">[pg iv]</span><a name="Pgiv" id="Pgiv" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> be uttered as in Italian or German.
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ḫ</span></span> is a strong guttural like the
        Scotch <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ch</span></span> in <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“loch”</span>; <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">m</span></span> had sometimes the pronunciation
        of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">w</span></span>, as in Tiamtu (= Tiawthu), so
        that the spelling of some of the words containing that letter may
        later have to be modified. The pronunciation of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span> and
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">š</span></span> is doubtful, but Assyriologists
        generally (and probably wrongly) give the sound of <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></span> to the
        former and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sh</span></span> to the latter. <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">T</span></span> was
        often pronounced as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">th</span></span>, and probably always had that
        sound in the feminine endings <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">-tu</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">-ti</span></span>,
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">-ta</span></span>, or <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">at</span></span>, so
        that Tiamtu, for instance, may be pronounced Tiawthu,
        Tukulti-âpil-Êšarra (Tiglath-pileser), Tukulthi-âpil-Êšarra, etc.,
        etc., and in such words as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">qâtâ</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        hands,”</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">šumāti</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“names,”</span> and many others, this was probably always
        the case. In the names Âbil-Addu-nathanu and Nathanu-yâwa this
        transcription has been adopted, and may be regarded as correct.
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">P</span></span> was likewise often aspirated,
        assuming the sound of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ph</span></span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span>, and
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">k</span></span> assumed, at least in later
        times, a sound similar to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ḫ (kh)</span></span>, whilst <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span> seems
        sometimes to have been pronounced as <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">v</span></span>.
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">G</span></span> was, to all appearance, never
        soft, as in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">gem</span></em>, but may sometimes have been
        aspirated. Each member of the group <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ph</span></span> is
        pronounced separately. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ṭ</span></span> is an emphatic <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">t</span></span>,
        stronger than in the word <span class="tei tei-q">“time.”</span> A
        terminal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To find out how
          the world was made, or rather, to give forth a theory accounting
          for its origin and continued existence, is one of the subjects that
          has attracted the attention of thinking minds among all nations
          having any pretension to civilization. It was, therefore, to be
          expected that the ancient Babylonians and Assyrians, far advanced
          in civilization as they were at an exceedingly early date, should
          have formed opinions thereupon, and placed them on record as soon
          as those opinions were matured, and the art of writing had been
          perfected sufficiently to enable a serviceable account to be
          composed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This, naturally,
          did not take place all at once. We may take it for granted that the
          history of the Creation grew piece by piece, as different minds
          thought over and elaborated it. The first theories we should expect
          to find more or less improbable—wild stories of serpents and gods,
          emblematic of the conflicting powers of good and evil, which, with
          them, had their origin before the advent of mankind upon the
          earth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But all men
          would not have the same opinion of the way in which the universe
          came into existence, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg
          010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and this would give rise, as really happened in Babylonia, to
          conflicting accounts or theories, the later ones less improbable
          than, and therefore superior to, the earlier. The earlier
          Creation-legend, being a sort of heroic poem, would remain popular
          with the common people, who always love stories of heroes and
          mighty conflicts, such as those in which the Babylonians and
          Assyrians to the latest times delighted, and of which the Semitic
          Babylonian Creation-story consists.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the ages
          passed by, and the newer theories grew up, the older popular ones
          would be elaborated, and new ideas from the later theories of the
          Creation would be incorporated, whilst, at the same time, mystical
          meanings would be given to the events recorded in the earlier
          legends to make them fit in with the newer ones. This having been
          done, the scribes could appeal at the same time to both ignorant
          and learned, explaining how the crude legends of the past were but
          a type of the doctrines put forward by the philosophers of later
          and more enlightened days, bringing within the range of the
          intellect of the unlearned all those things in which the more
          thoughtful spirits also believed. By this means an enlightened
          monotheism and the grossest polytheism could, and did, exist side
          by side, as well as clever and reasonable cosmologies along with
          the strangest and wildest legends.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus it is that
          we have from the literature of two closely allied peoples, the
          Babylonians and the Hebrews, accounts of the Creation of the world
          so widely differing, and, at the same time, possessing, here and
          there, certain ideas in common—ideas darkly veiled in the old
          Babylonian story, but clearly expressed in the comparatively late
          Hebrew account.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It must not be
          thought, however, that the above theory as to the origin of the
          Hebrew Creation-story interferes in any way with the doctrine of
          its inspiration. We are not bound to accept the opinion so
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name=
          "Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> generally held by
          theologians, that the days of creation referred to in Genesis i.
          probably indicate that each act of creation—each day—was revealed
          in seven successive dreams, in order, to the inspired writer of the
          book. The opinion held by other theologians, that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“inspiration”</span> simply means that the writer was
          moved by the Spirit of God to choose from documents already
          existing such portions as would serve for our enlightenment and
          instruction, adding, at the same time, such additions of his own as
          he was led to think to be needful, may be held to be a satisfactory
          definition of the term in question.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Without,
          therefore, binding ourselves down to any hard and fast line as to
          date, we may regard, for the purposes of this inquiry, the Hebrew
          account of the Creation as one of the traditions handed down in the
          thought of many minds extending over many centuries, and as having
          been chosen and elaborated by the inspired writer of Genesis for
          the purpose of his narrative, the object of which was to set forth
          the origin of man and the Hebrew nation, to which he belonged, and
          whose history he was about to narrate in detail.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hebrew story
          of the Creation, as detailed in Genesis i., may be regarded as one
          of the most remarkable documents ever produced. It must not be
          forgotten, however, that it is a document that is essentially
          Hebrew. For the author of this book the language of God and of the
          first man was Hebrew—a literary language, showing much phonetic
          decay. The retention of this matter (its omission not being
          essential at the period of the composition of the book) is probably
          due, in part, to the natural patriotism of the writer, overruling
          what ought to have been his inspired common-sense. How this is to
          be explained it is not the intention of the writer of this book to
          inquire, the account of the Creation and its parallels being the
          subject in hand at present.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question of
          language apart, the account of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page012">[pg 012]</span><a name="Pg012" id="Pg012" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Creation in Genesis is in the highest degree
          a common-sense one. The creation of (1) the heaven, and (2) the
          earth; the darkness—not upon the face of the earth, but upon the
          face of the deep. Then the expansion dividing the waters above from
          the waters below on the earth. In the midst of this waste of waters
          dry land afterwards appears, followed by the growth of vegetation.
          But the sun and the moon had not yet been appointed, nor the stars,
          all of which come into being at this point. Last of all are
          introduced the living things of the earth—fish, and bird, and
          creeping thing, followed by the animals, and, finally, by man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is noteworthy
          and interesting that, in this account, the acts of creation are
          divided into seven periods, each of which is called a <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“day,”</span> and begins, like the natural day in the
          time-reckoning of the Semitic nations, with the
          evening—<span class="tei tei-q">“and it was evening, and it was
          morning, day one.”</span> It describes what the heavenly bodies
          were for—they were not only to give light upon the earth—they were
          also for signs, for seasons, for days, and for years.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And then,
          concerning man, a very circumstantial account is given. He was to
          have dominion over everything upon the earth—the fish of the sea,
          the fowl of the air, the cattle, and every creeping thing. All was
          given to him, and he, like the creatures made before him, was told
          to <span class="tei tei-q">“be fruitful, and multiply, and
          replenish the earth.”</span> It is with this crowning work of
          creation that the first chapter of the Book of Genesis ends.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second
          chapter refers to the seventh day—the day of rest, and is followed
          by further details of the creation, the central figure of which is
          the last thing created, namely, man. This chapter reads, in part,
          like a recapitulation of the first, but contains many additional
          details. <span class="tei tei-q">“No plant of the field was yet in
          the earth, and no herb ... had sprung up: for the Lord <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> God had not caused it to rain ..., and
          there was not a man to till the ground.”</span> A mist, therefore,
          went up from the earth, and watered all the face of the ground.
          Then, to till the earth, man was formed from the dust of the
          ground, and the Lord God <span class="tei tei-q">“breathed into his
          nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living
          soul.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          newly-created man was, at this time, innocent, and was therefore to
          be placed by his Creator in a garden of delight, named Eden, and
          this garden he was to dress and keep. A hidden danger, however, lay
          in this pleasant retreat—the tree of knowledge of good and evil, of
          which he was forbidden to eat, but which was to form for him a
          constant temptation, for ever testing his obedience. All might have
          been well, to all appearance, but for the creation of woman, who,
          giving way to the blandishments of the tempter, in her turn tempted
          the man, and he fell. Death in the course of nature was the
          penalty, the earthly paradise was lost, and all chance of eating of
          the tree of life, and living for ever, disappeared on man's
          expulsion from his first abode of delight.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the course of
          this narrative interesting details are given—the four rivers, the
          country through which they flowed, and their precious mineral
          products; the naming of the various animals by the man; the forming
          of woman from one of his ribs; the institution of marriage,
          etc.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is, in
          short, the story of the Creation as told in the Bible, and it is
          this that we have to compare with the now well-known parallel
          accounts current among the ancient Babylonians and Assyrians. And
          here may be noted at the outset that, though we shall find some
          parallels, we shall, in the course of our comparison, find a far
          greater number of differences, for not only were they produced in a
          different land, by a different people, but they were also produced
          under different conditions. Thus, Babylonian polytheism takes the
          place of the severe and uncompromising <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page014">[pg 014]</span><a name="Pg014" id="Pg014" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> monotheism of the Hebrew account in Genesis;
          Eden was, to the Babylonians, their own native land, not a country
          situated at a remote distance; and, lastly, but not least, their
          language, thoughts, and feelings differed widely from those of the
          dwellers in the Holy Land.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Babylonian
          story of the Creation is a narrative of great interest to all who
          occupy themselves with the study of ancient legends and folklore.
          It introduces us not only to exceedingly ancient beliefs concerning
          the origin of the world on which we live, but it tells us also of
          the religion, or, rather, the religious beliefs, of the
          Babylonians, and enables us to see something of the changes which
          those beliefs underwent before adopting the form in which we find
          them at the time this record was composed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A great deal has
          been written about the Babylonian story of the Creation. As is well
          known, the first translation of these documents was by him who
          first discovered their nature, the late George Smith, who gave them
          to the world in his well-known book, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">The Chaldean Account
          of Genesis</span></span>, in 1875. Since that time numerous other
          translations have appeared, not only in England, but also on the
          Continent. Among those who have taken part in the work of studying
          and translating these texts may be named Profs. Sayce, Oppert,
          Hommel, and Delitzsch, the last-named having both edited the first
          edition of Smith's book (the first issued on this subject on the
          Continent), and published one of the last and most complete
          editions of the whole legend yet placed before the public. To Prof.
          Sayce, as well as to Prof. Hommel, belongs the honour of many
          brilliant suggestions as to the tendency of the texts of the
          creation as a whole: Prof. Oppert was the first to point out that
          the last tablet of the series was not, as Smith thought, an
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Address to primitive man,”</span> but an
          address to the god Merodach as the restorer of order out of chaos;
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name=
          "Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> whilst Delitzsch has
          perhaps (being almost the last to write upon it) improved the
          translation more than many of his predecessors in the work.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before
          proceeding to deal with the legend itself, a few remarks upon the
          tablets and the text that they bear will probably not be considered
          out of place. There are, in all likelihood, but few who have not
          seen in the British Museum or elsewhere those yellow baked
          terra-cotta tablets of various sizes and shapes, upon which the
          Babylonians and Assyrians were accustomed to write their records.
          And well it is for the science of Assyriology that they used this
          exceedingly durable material. I have said that the tablets are
          yellow in colour, and this is generally the case, but the tint
          varies greatly, and may approach dark grey or black, and even
          appear as a very good sage-green. The smaller tablets are often
          cushion-shaped, but, with some few exceptions, they are
          rectangular, like those of larger size. The writing varies so
          considerably that the hand of the various scribes can sometimes be
          distinguished. In the best class of tablets every tenth line is
          often numbered—a proof that the Assyrians and Babylonians were very
          careful with the documents with which they had to deal. The
          Babylonian tablets closely resemble the Assyrian, but the style of
          the writing differs somewhat, and it is, in general, more difficult
          to read than the Assyrian. None of the tablets of the
          Creation-series are, unfortunately, perfect, and many of the
          fragments are mere scraps, but as more than one copy of each
          anciently existed, and has survived, the wanting parts of one text
          can often be supplied from another copy. That copies come from
          Babylon as well as from Nineveh is a very fortunate circumstance,
          as our records are rendered more complete thereby.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the obverse
          of the first tablet very little, unfortunately, remains, but what
          there is extant is of the highest interest. Luckily, we have the
          beginning of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is the
          tenor of the opening lines of the Babylonian story of the Creation,
          and the differences between the two accounts are striking enough.
          Before proceeding, however, to examine and compare them, a few
          words upon the Babylonian version may not be without value.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">First we must
          note that the above introduction to the legend has been excellently
          explained and commented upon by the Syrian writer Damascius. The
          following is his explanation of the Babylonian teaching concerning
          the creation of the world—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“But the Babylonians, like the rest of the Barbarians,
          pass over in silence the one principle of the Universe, and they
          constitute two, Tauthé and Apason, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> making Apason the husband of Tauthé, and
          denominating her the mother of the gods. And from these proceeds an
          only-begotten son, Moumis, which, I conceive, is no other than the
          intelligible world proceeding from the two principles. From them,
          also, another progeny is derived, Daché and Dachos; and again a
          third, Kissaré and Assoros, from which last three others proceed,
          Anos, and Illinos, and Aos. And of Aos and Dauké is born a son
          called Belos, who, they say, is the fabricator of the world, the
          Creator.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The likeness of
          the names given in this extract from Damascius will be noticed, and
          will probably also be recognized as a valuable verification of the
          certainty now attained by Assyriologists in the reading of the
          proper names. In Tiamtu, or, rather, Tiawthu, will be easily
          recognized the Tauthé of Damascius, whose son, as appears from a
          later fragment, was called Mummu (= Moumis). Apason he gives as the
          husband of Tauthé, but of this we know nothing from the Babylonian
          tablet, which, however, speaks of this Apason (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">apsû</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the abyss”</span>), which corresponds with the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“primæval ocean”</span> of the Babylonian
          tablet.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Daché and
          Dachos it is easy to see that there has been a confusion between
          Greek Λ and Δ, which so closely resemble each other. Daché and
          Dachos should, therefore, be corrected into Laché and Lachos, the
          Laḫmu and Laḫamu (better Laḫwu and Laḫawu) of the Babylonian text.
          They were the male and female personifications of the heavens.
          Anšar and Kišar are the Greek author's Assoros and Kisaré, the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Host of Heaven”</span> and the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Host of Earth”</span> respectively. The
          three proceeding from them, Anos, Illinos, and Aos, are the
          well-known Anu, the god of the heavens; Illil, for En-lila, the
          Sumerian god of the earth and the Underworld; and Aa or Ea, the god
          of the waters, who seems to have been <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> identified by some with Yau or Jah. Aa or Ea
          was the husband of Damkina, or Dawkina, the Dauké of Damascius,
          from whom, as he says, Belos, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Bel-Merodach, was born, and
          if he did not <span class="tei tei-q">“fabricate the world,”</span>
          at least he ordered it anew, after his great fight with the Dragon
          of Chaos, as we shall see when we come to the third tablet of the
          series.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the lines
          printed above the text is rather defective, but it would seem that
          the god Nudimmud (Ae or Ea), <span class="tei tei-q">“the wise and
          open of ear,”</span> next came into existence. A comparison is then
          apparently made between these deities on the one hand, and Tiamtu,
          Apsû, and Mummu on the other—to the disadvantage of the latter. On
          Apsû complaining that he had no peace by day nor rest by night on
          account of the ways of the gods, their sons, it was at last
          determined to make war upon them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such are the
          last verses of the first tablet of the so-called story of the
          Creation as known to the Babylonians, and though it would be better
          named if called the Story of Bêl and the Dragon, the references to
          the creation of the world that are made therein prevent the name
          from being absolutely incorrect, and it may, therefore, serve,
          along with the more correct one, to designate it still. As will be
          gathered from the above, the whole story centres in the wish of the
          goddess of the powers of evil to get creation—the production of all
          that is in the world—into her own hands. In this she is aided by
          certain gods, over whom she sets one, Kingu, her husband, as chief.
          In the preparations that she makes she exercises her creative
          powers to produce all kinds of dreadful monsters to help her
          against the gods whom she wishes to overthrow, and the full and
          vigorous description of her defenders, created by her own hands,
          adds much to the charm of the narrative, and shows well what the
          Babylonian scribes were capable of in this class of record.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first tablet
          breaks off after the speech of Tiamtu to her husband Kingu. The
          second one begins by stating how Aa or Ea heard of the plot of
          Tiamtu and her followers against the gods of heaven. When his first
          wrath on account of this had somewhat abated, he went and related
          the whole, in practically the same words as the story is given on
          the two foregoing pages, to Anšar, his father, who in his turn
          became filled with rage, biting his lips, and uttering cries of
          deepest grief. In the mutilated lines which follow Apsû's
          subjugation seems to be referred to. After this is another
          considerable gap, and then comes the statement that Anšar applied
          to his son Anu, <span class="tei tei-q">“the mighty and brave,
          whose power is great, whose attack irresistible,”</span> saying
          that if he will only speak to her, the great Dragon's anger will be
          calmed and her rage disappear.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How the god
          excused himself to his father Anšar on account of his ignominious
          flight we do not know, the record being again defective at this
          point. With the same want of success the god Anšar then, as we
          learn from another part of the narrative, applied to the god
          Nudimmud, a deity who is explained in the inscriptions as being the
          same as the god Aa or Ea, but whom Professor Delitzsch is rather
          inclined to regard as one of the forms of Bêl.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the end the
          god Merodach, the son of Aa, was asked to be the champion of the
          gods against the great emblem of the powers of evil, the Dragon of
          Chaos. To become, by this means, the saviour of the universe, was
          apparently just what the patron-god of the city of Babylon desired,
          for he seems immediately to have accepted the task of destroying
          the hated Dragon—</p>

          delay, calls his messenger Gaga, and directs him to summon all the
          gods to a festival, where with appetite they may sit down to a

          let Merodach <span class="tei tei-q">“decide the fates,”</span> as

          became as one possessed, and cried aloud. Muttering then
          incantations and charms, she called the gods of battle to arms, and

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Being now at the
          mercy of the conqueror, the divine victor soon made an end of the
          enemy of the gods, upon whose mutilated body, when dead, he stood
          triumphantly. Great fear now overwhelmed the gods who had gone over
          to her side, and fought against the heavenly powers, and they fled
          to save their lives. Powerless to escape, however, they were
          captured, and their weapons broken to pieces. Notwithstanding their
          cries, which filled the vast region, they had to bear the
          punishment which was their due, and were shut up in prison. The
          creatures whom Tiamtu had created to help her and strike terror
          into the hearts of the gods, were also brought into subjection,
          along with Kingu, her husband, from whom the tablets of fate were
          taken by the conqueror as things unmeet for Tiamtu's spouse to own.
          It is probable that we have here the true explanation of the origin
          of this remarkable legend, for the tablets of fate were evidently
          things which the king of heaven alone might possess, and Merodach,
          as soon as he had overcome his foe, pressed his own seal upon them,
          and placed them in his breast.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He had now
          conquered the enemy, the proud opposer of the gods of heaven, and
          having placed her defeated followers in safe custody, he was able
          to return to the dead and defeated Dragon of Chaos. He split open
          her skull with his unsparing weapon, hewed asunder the channels of
          her blood, and caused the north wind to carry it away to hidden
          places. His fathers saw this, and rejoiced with shouting, and
          brought him gifts and offerings.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page026">[pg 026]</span><a name="Pg026" id="Pg026" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And there, as he
          rested from the strife, Merodach looked upon her who had wrought
          such evil in the fair world as created by the gods, and as he
          looked, he thought out clever plans. Hewing asunder the corpse of
          the great Dragon that lay lifeless before him, he made with one
          half a covering for the heavens, keeping it in its place by means
          of a bolt, and setting there a watchman to keep guard. He also
          arranged this portion of the Dragon of Chaos in such a way, that
          <span class="tei tei-q">“her waters could not come forth,”</span>
          and this circumstance suggests a comparison with <span class=

          story in Genesis.</p>

          apparently, a fragment that may be regarded as recording the

          the houses of the great gods, and the cities Nippuru (Niffer) and

          proclaimed and announced was apparently his glorious names, as
          detailed in the seventh and last tablet of the series, which was
          regarded by George Smith as containing an address to primitive man,
          but which proves to be really an address to the god Merodach
          praising him on account of the great work that he had done in
          overcoming the Dragon, and in thereafter ordering the world anew.
          As this portion forms a good specimen of Babylonian poetry at its
          best, the full text of the tablet, with the exception of some short
          remains of lines, is here presented in as careful a translation as
          is at present possible.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the foregoing
          pages the reader has had placed before him all the principal
          details of the Babylonian story of the Creation, and we may now
          proceed to examine the whole in greater detail.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we may take
          the explanation of Damascius as representing fairly the opinion of
          the Babylonians concerning the creation of the world, it seems
          clear that they regarded the matter of which it was formed as
          existing in the beginning under the two forms of Tiamtu (the sea)
          and <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Apsû</span></span> (the deep), and from these,
          being wedded, proceeded <span class="tei tei-q">“an only begotten
          son,”</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Mummu</span></span> (Moumis), conceived by
          Damascius to be <span class="tei tei-q">“no other that the
          intelligible world proceeding from the two principles,”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> from Tiamtu and
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Apsû</span></span>. From these come forth, in
          successive generations, the other gods, ending with Marduk or
          Merodach, also named Bêl (Bêl-Merodach), the son of Aa (Ea) and his
          consort Damkina (the Aos and Dauké of Damascius).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judging from the
          material that we have, the Babylonians seemed to have believed in a
          kind of evolution, for they evidently regarded the first creative
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name=
          "Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> powers (the watery
          waste and the abyss) as the rude and barbaric beginnings of things,
          the divine powers produced from these first principles (Laḫmu and
          Laḫamu, Anšar and Kišar, Anu, Ellila, and Aa, and finally Marduk),
          being successive stages in the upward path towards perfection, with
          which the first rude elements of creation were ultimately bound to
          come into conflict; for Tiamtu, the chief of the two rude and
          primitive principles of creation, was, notwithstanding this,
          ambitious, and desired still to be the creatress of the gods and
          other inferior beings that were yet to be produced. All the
          divinities descending from Tiamtu were, to judge from the
          inscriptions, creators, and as they advanced towards perfection, so
          also did the things that they created advance, until, by contrast,
          the works of Tiamtu became as those of the Evil Principle, and when
          she rebelled against the gods who personified all that was good, it
          became a battle between them of life and death, which only the
          latest-born of the gods, elected in consequence of the perfection
          of his power, to be king and ruler over <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the gods his fathers,”</span> was found worthy to
          wage. The glorious victory gained, and the Dragon of Evil subdued
          and relegated to those places where her exuberant producing power,
          which, to all appearance, she still possessed, would be of use,
          Merodach, in the fulness of his power as king of the gods,
          perfected and ordered the universe anew, and created his crowning
          work, Mankind. Many details are, to all appearance, wanting on
          account of the incompleteness of the series, but those which remain
          seem to indicate that the motive of the whole story was as outlined
          here.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Genesis,
          however, we have an entirely different account, based, apparently,
          upon a widely different conception of the origin of the Universe,
          for one principle only appears throughout the whole narrative, be
          it Elohistic, Jehovistic, or priestly. <span class="tei tei-q">“In
          the beginning <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg
          035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          God created the heavens and the earth,”</span> and from the first
          verse to the last it is He, and He alone, who is Creator and Maker
          and Ruler of the Universe. The only passage containing any
          indication that more than one person took part in the creation of
          the world and all that therein is, is in verse 26, where God is
          referred to as saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Let <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">us</span></span> make man,”</span> but
          that this is simply the plural of majesty, and nothing more, seems
          to be proved by the very next verse, where the wording is,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“and God made man in <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">his</span></span> own image,”</span>
          etc. There is, therefore, no trace of polytheistic influence in the
          whole narrative.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Let us glance
          awhile at the other differences.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To begin with,
          the whole Babylonian narrative is not only based upon an entirely
          different theory of the beginning of all things, but upon an
          entirely different conception of what took place ere man appeared
          upon the earth. <span class="tei tei-q">“In the beginning God
          created the heavens and the earth,”</span> implies the conception
          of a time when the heavens and the earth existed not. Not so,
          seemingly, with the Babylonian account. There the heavens and the
          earth are represented as existing, though in a chaotic form, from
          the first. Moreover, it is not the external will and influence of
          the Almighty that originates and produces the forms of the first
          creatures inhabiting the world, but the productive power residing
          in the watery waste and the deep:</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The legend is
          too defective to enable us to find out anything as to the
          Babylonian idea concerning the formation of the dry land. Testimony
          as to its non-existence <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page036">[pg
          036]</span><a name="Pg036" id="Pg036" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          at the earliest period is all that is vouchsafed to us. At that
          time none of the gods had come forth, seemingly because (if the
          restoration be correct) <span class="tei tei-q">“the fates had not
          been determined.”</span> There is no clue, however, as to who was
          then the determiner of the fates.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, gradually,
          and in the course of long-extended ages, the gods Laḫmu and Laḫamu,
          Anšar and Kišar, with the others, came into existence, as already
          related, after which the record, which is mutilated, goes on to
          speak of Tiamtu, Apsū, and Mummu.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These deities of
          the Abyss were evidently greatly disquieted on account of the
          existence and the work of the gods of heaven. They therefore took
          counsel together, and Apsū complained that he could not rest either
          night or day on account of them. Naturally the mutilated state of
          the text makes the true reason of the conflict somewhat uncertain.
          Fried. Delitzsch regarded it as due to the desire, on the part of
          Merodach, to have possession of the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Tablets of Fate,”</span> which the powers of good and
          the powers of evil both wished to obtain. These documents, when
          they are first spoken of, are in the hands of Tiamtu (see p.
          <a href="#Pg019" class="tei tei-ref">19</a>), and she, on giving
          the power of changeless command to Kingu, her husband, handed them
          to him. In the great fight, when Merodach overcame his foes, he
          seized these precious records, and placed them in his breast—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all
          appearance, Tiamtu and Kingu were in unlawful possession of these
          documents, and the king <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page037">[pg
          037]</span><a name="Pg037" id="Pg037" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of the gods, Merodach, when he seized them, only took possession of
          what, in reality, was his own. What power the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Tablets of Fate”</span> conferred on their possessor,
          we do not know, but in all probability the god in whose hands they
          were, became, by the very fact, creator and ruler of the universe
          for ever and ever.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This creative
          power the king of the gods at once proceeded to exercise. Passing
          through the heavens, he surveyed them, and built a palace called
          Ê-šarra, <span class="tei tei-q">“The house of the host,”</span>
          for the gods who, with himself, might be regarded as the chief in
          his heavenly kingdom. Next in order he arranged the heavenly
          bodies, forming the constellations, marking off the year; the moon,
          and probably the sun also, being, as stated in Genesis,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“for signs, and for seasons, and for days
          and years,”</span> though all this is detailed, in the Babylonian
          account, at much greater length. Indeed, had we the whole legend
          complete, we should probably find ourselves in possession of a
          detailed description of the Babylonian idea of the heavens which
          they studied so constantly, and of the world on which they lived,
          in relation to the celestial phenomena which they saw around
          them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fragments of
          tablets have been spoken of that seem to belong to the fifth and
          sixth of the series, and one of them speaks of the building of
          certain ancient cities, including that now represented by the
          mounds known by the name of Niffer, which must, therefore, apart
          from any considerations of paleographic progression in the case of
          inscriptions found there, or evidence based on the depth of
          rubbish-accumulations, be one of the oldest known. It is probably
          on account of this that the Talmudic writers identified the site
          with the Calneh of Gen. x. 10, which, notwithstanding the absence
          of native confirmation, may very easily be correct, for the Jews of
          those days were undoubtedly in a better position to know than we
          are, after a lapse of two thousand years. The same text, strangely
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page038">[pg 038]</span><a name=
          "Pg038" id="Pg038" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> enough, also refers
          to the city of Aššur, though this city (which did not, apparently,
          belong to Nimrod's kingdom) can hardly have been a primæval city in
          the same sense as <span class="tei tei-q">“Babel, and Erech, and
          Accad, and Calneh.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The text of the
          Semitic Creation-story is here so mutilated as to be useless for
          comparative purposes, and in these circumstances the bilingual
          story of the Creation, published by me in 1891, practically
          covering, as it does, the same ground, may be held, in a measure,
          to supply its place. Instead, therefore, of devoting to this
          version a separate section, I insert a translation of it here,
          together with a description of the tablet upon which it is
          written.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This second
          version of the Creation-story is inscribed on a large fragment
          (about four and a half inches high) of a tablet found by Mr. Rassam
          at Sippar (Abu Habbah) in 1882. The text is very neatly written in
          the Babylonian character, and is given twice over, that is, in the
          original (dialectic) Akkadian, with a Semitic (Babylonian)
          translation. As it was the custom of the Babylonian and Assyrian
          scribes, for the sake of giving a nice appearance to what they
          wrote, to spread out the characters in such a way that the page (as
          it were) was <span class="tei tei-q">“justified,”</span> and the
          ends of the lines ranged, like a page of print, it often happens
          that, when a line is not a full one, there is a wide space, in the
          middle, without writing. In the Akkadian text of the bilingual
          Creation-story, however, a gap is left in <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every</span></em>
          line, sufficiently large to accommodate, in slightly smaller
          characters, the whole Semitic Babylonian translation. The tablet
          therefore seems to be written in three columns, the first being the
          first half of the Akkadian version, the second (a broad one) the
          Semitic translation, and the third the last half of the Akkadian
          original text, separated from the first part to allow of the
          Semitic version being inserted between.</p><span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page039">[pg 039]</span><a name="Pg039" id="Pg039" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reason of
          the writing of the version already translated and in part commented
          upon is not difficult to find—it was to give an account of the
          origin of the world and the gods whom they worshipped. The reason
          of the writing of the bilingual story of the Creation, however, is
          not so easy to decide, the account there given being the
          introduction to one of those bilingual incantations for
          purification, in which, however, by the mutilation of the tablet,
          the connecting-link is unfortunately lost. But whatever the reason
          of its being prefixed to this incantation, the value and importance
          of the version presented by this new document is incontestable, not
          only for the legend itself, but also for the linguistic material
          which a bilingual text nearly always offers.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last line
          but one is apparently the title, and is followed by the first line
          of the next tablet. From <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page042">[pg
          042]</span><a name="Pg042" id="Pg042" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          this we see that this text belonged to a series of at least two
          tablets, and that the tablet following the above had an
          introduction of an astronomical or astrological nature.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
          noticed that this text not only contains an account of the creation
          of gods and men, and flora and fauna, but also of the great and
          renowned sites and shrines of the country where it originated. It
          is in this respect that it bears a likeness to the fragmentary
          portions of the intermediate tablets of the Semitic Babylonian
          story of the Creation, or Bêl and the Dragon, and this slight
          agreement may be held to justify, in some measure, its introduction
          here. The bilingual version, however, differs very much in style
          from that in Semitic only, and seems to lack the poetical form
          which characterizes the latter. This, indeed, was to be expected,
          for poetical form in a translation which follows the original
          closely is an impossibility, though the poetry of words and ideas
          which it contains naturally remains. It is not unlikely that the
          original Sumerian text is in poetical form, as is suggested by the
          cesura, and the recurring words.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the bilingual
          account of the Creation one seems to get a glimpse of the pride
          that the ancient Babylonians felt in the ancient and renowned
          cities of their country. The writer's conception of the wasteness
          and voidness of the earth in the beginning seems to have been that
          the ancient cities Babel, Niffer, Erech and Eridu had not yet come
          into existence. For him, those sites were as much creations as the
          vegetation and animal life of the earth. Being, for him, sacred
          sites, they must have had a sacred, a divine foundation, and he
          therefore attributes their origin to the greatest of the gods,
          Merodach, who built them, brick, and beam, and house, himself.
          Their renowned temples, too, had their origin at the hands of the
          Divine Architect of the Universe.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A few words are
          necessary in elucidation of what <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> follows the line, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“When within the sea there was a stream.”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“In that day,”</span> it says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Êridu was made, Ê-sagila was constructed—Ê-sagila
          which the god Lugal-du-azaga founded within the Abyss. Babylon he
          built, Ê-sagila was completed.”</span> The connection of Ê-sagila,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the temple of the lofty head,”</span>
          which was within the Abyss, with Êridu, shows, with little or no
          doubt, that the Êridu there referred to was not the earthly city of
          that name, but a city conceived as lying also <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“within the Abyss.”</span> This Êridu, as we shall see
          farther on, was the <span class="tei tei-q">“blessed city,”</span>
          or Paradise, wherein was the tree of life, and which was watered by
          the twin stream of the Tigris and the Euphrates.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there was
          another Ê-sagila than that founded by the god Lugal-du-azaga within
          the Abyss, namely the Ê-sagila at Babylon, and it is this fane that
          is spoken of in the phrase following that mentioning the temple so
          called within the Abyss. To the Babylonian, therefore, the capital
          of the country was, in that respect, a counterpart of the divine
          city that he regarded as the abode of bliss, where dwelt Nammu, the
          river-god, and the sun-god Dumuzi-Abzu, or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Tammuz of the Abyss.”</span> Like Sippar too, Babylon
          was situated in what was called the plain, the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">edina</span></span>, of which Babylonia mainly
          consisted, and which is apparently the original of the Garden of
          Eden.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The present text
          differs from that of the longer (Semitic) story of the Creation, in
          that it makes Merodach to be the creator of the gods, as well as of
          mankind, and all living things. This, of course, implies that it
          was composed at a comparatively late date, when the god Merodach
          had become fully recognized as the chief divinity, and the fact
          that Aa was his father had been lost sight of, and practically
          forgotten. The goddess Aruru is apparently introduced into the
          narrative out of consideration for the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> city Sippar-Aruru, of which she was patron.
          In another text she is called <span class="tei tei-q">“Lady of the
          gods of Sippar and Aruru.”</span> There is also a goddess (perhaps
          identical with her) called Gala-aruru, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Great Aruru,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          great one (of) Aruru,”</span> who is explained as <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ištar the star,”</span> on the tablet K. 2109.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the
          account of the creation of the beasts of the field, the Tigris and
          the Euphrates, vegetation, lands, marshes, thickets, plantations
          and forests, which are named, to all appearance, without any
          attempt at any kind of order, <span class="tei tei-q">“The lord
          Merodach”</span> is represented as creating those things which, at
          first, he had not made, namely, the great and ancient shrines in
          whose antiquity and glorious memories the Babylonian—and the
          Assyrian too—took such delight. The list, however, is a short one,
          and it is to be supposed that, in the lines that are broken away,
          further cities of the kingdom of Babylon were mentioned. That this
          was the case is implied by the reverse, which deals mainly—perhaps
          exclusively—with the great shrine of Borsippa called Ê-zida, and
          identified by many with the Tower of Babel. How it was brought in,
          however, we have no means of finding out, and must wait patiently
          for the completion of the text that will, in all probability,
          ultimately be discovered.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reverse has
          only the end of the text, which, as far as it is preserved, is in
          the form of an <span class="tei tei-q">“incantation of
          Êridu,”</span> and mentions <span class="tei tei-q">“the glorious
          fountain of the Abyss,”</span> which to was to <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“purify”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“make
          glorious”</span> the pathway of the personified fane referred to.
          As it was the god Merodach, <span class="tei tei-q">“the merciful
          one,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“he who raises the dead to
          life,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the lord of the glorious
          incantation,”</span> who was regarded by the Babylonians as
          revealing to mankind the <span class="tei tei-q">“incantation of
          Êridu,”</span> which he, in his turn, obtained from his father Aa,
          we may see in this final part of the legend not only a
          glorification of the chief deity of the Babylonians, but also a
          further testimony of the fact that the composition <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page045">[pg 045]</span><a name="Pg045" id="Pg045"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> must belong to the comparatively late
          period in the history of Babylonian religion, when the worship of
          Merodach had taken the place of that of his father Aa.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of course, it
          must not be supposed that the longer account of the Creation was
          told so shortly as the bilingual narrative that we have introduced
          here to supply the missing parts of the longer version. Everything
          was probably recounted at much greater length, and in confirmation
          of this there is the testimony of the small fragment of the longer
          account, translated on p. <a href="#Pg028" class=
          "tei tei-ref">28</a>. This simply contains the announcement that
          Merodach had made cunning plans, and decided to create man from his
          own blood, and [to form?] his bones, but there must have been, in
          the long gap which then ensues, a detailed account of the actual
          creation of the human race, probably with some reference to the
          formation of animals. One cannot base much upon this mutilated
          fragment, but, as the first translator has pointed out, the object
          in creating man was seemingly to ensure the performance of the
          service (or worship) of the gods, and the building of their
          shrines, prayer and sacrifice, with the fear of God, being duties
          from which there was no escape.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the last
          tablet of the series—that recording the praises of Merodach and his
          fifty new names,—there are a few points that are worthy of
          examination. In the first place, the arrangement of the first part
          is noteworthy. The principal name that was given to him seems not
          to have been Merodach, as one would expect from the popularity of
          the name in later days, but Tutu, which occurs in the margin, at
          the head of six of the sections, and was probably prefixed to at
          least three more. This name Tutu is evidently an Akkadian
          reduplicate word, from the root <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tu</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“to
          beget,”</span> and corresponds with the explanation of the word
          given by the list of Babylonian gods, K. 2107; <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">muâllid îlāni,
          mûddiš îlāni</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“begetter of
          the gods, renewer <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg
          046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of the gods”</span>—a name probably given to him on account of his
          identification with his father, Aa, for, according to the legend,
          Merodach was rather the youngest than the oldest of the gods, who
          are even called, as will be remembered, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“his fathers.”</span> In the lost portion at the
          beginning of the final tablet he was also called, according to the
          tablet here quoted, Gugu = <span class=

          these last names were probably enumerated on the lost part of the

          the narrative, and the whole of the fifty names conferred upon him,
          which were enumerated in their old Akkadian forms and translated
          into Semitic Babylonian in this final tablet of the Creation, were
          evidently repeated in the form of a list of gods, on the tablet in
          tabular form from which the above renderings are taken.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Hailed then as

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the traverser of the heavens (one of
          the points of contact between Babylonian and Greek mythology), the
          stars of which he was regarded as directing, and keeping (lit.
          pasturing) like sheep. (Gods and stars may here be regarded as
          convertible terms.) His future is then spoken of, and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“father Bêl”</span> gives him his own name,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“lord of the world.”</span> Rejoicing in
          the honours showered on his son, and not to be outdone in
          generosity, Aa decrees that henceforth Merodach shall be like him,
          and that he shall be called Aa, possessing all his commands, and
          all his pronouncements—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> all the wisdom which he, as
          god of deep wisdom, possessed. Thus was Merodach endowed with all
          the names, and all the attributes, of the gods of the
          Babylonians—<span class="tei tei-q">“the fifty renowned names of
          the great gods.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This was, to all
          intents and purposes, symbolic of a great struggle, in early days,
          between polytheism and monotheism—for the masses the former, for
          the more learned and thoughtful the latter. Of this we shall have
          further proof farther on, when discussing the name of Merodach. For
          the present be it simply noted, that this is not the only text
          identifying Merodach with the other gods.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reference to
          the creation of mankind in line 29 of the obverse (p. <a href=
          "#Pg031" class="tei tei-ref">31</a>) is noteworthy, notwithstanding
          that the translation of one of the words—and that a very important
          one—is very doubtful. Apparently man was created to the despite of
          the rebellious gods, but there is also just the possibility that
          there exists here an idiomatic phrase meaning <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“in their room.”</span> If the latter be the true
          rendering, this part of the legend would be in striking accord with
          Bishop Avitus of Vienne, with the old English poet Caedmon, and
          with Milton in his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Paradise Lost</span></span>. In connection
          with this, too, the statement in the reverse, lines 113 and 114,
          where <span class="tei tei-q">“man's remote ages”</span> is
          referred to, naturally leads one to ask, Have we here <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> traces of a belief that, in ages to
          come (<span class="tei tei-q">“in lateness of days”</span>),
          Merodach was to return and live among men into the remote future?
          The return of a divinity or a hero of much-cherished memory is such
          a usual thing among popular beliefs, that this may well have been
          the case likewise among the Babylonians.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The comparison
          of the two accounts of the Creation—that of the Hebrews and that of
          the Babylonians, that have been presented to the reader—will
          probably have brought prominently before him the fact, that the
          Babylonian account, notwithstanding all that has been said to the
          contrary, differs so much from the Biblical account, that they are,
          to all intents and purposes, two distinct narratives. That there
          are certain ideas in common, cannot be denied, but most of them are
          ideas that are inseparable from two accounts of the same event,
          notwithstanding that they have been composed from two totally
          different standpoints. In writing an account of the Creation,
          statements as to what are the things created must of necessity be
          inserted. There is, therefore, no proof of a connection between two
          accounts of the Creation in the fact that they both speak of the
          formation of dry land, or because they both state that plants,
          animals, and man were created. Connection may be inferred from such
          statements that the waters were the first abode of life, or that an
          expansion was created dividing the waters above from those below.
          With reference to such points of contact as these just mentioned,
          however, the question naturally arises, Are these points of
          similarity sufficient to justify the belief that two so widely
          divergent accounts as those of the Bible and of the Babylonian
          tablets have one and the same origin? In the mind of the present
          writer there seems to be but one answer, and that is, that the two
          accounts are practically distinct, and are the production of people
          having entirely different ideas upon the subject, though they may
          have influenced each other <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class=

          mentioned above. For the rest, the fact that there is—</p>

          legend of Bêl and the Dragon, and that, as such, it is simply the
          glorification of Merodach, the patron divinity of the Babylonians,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many a
          penitential psalm and hymn of praise exists to testify to the piety
          of the ancient nations of Assyria and Babylonia. Moreover, this
          piety was, to all appearance, practical, calling forth not only
          self-denying offerings and sacrifices, but also, as we shall see
          farther on, lofty ideas and expressions of the highest religious
          feeling.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And the
          Babylonians were evidently proud of their religion. Whatever its
          defects, the more enlightened—the scribes and those who could
          read—seem to have felt that there was something in it that gave it
          the very highest place. And they were right—there was in this gross
          polytheism of theirs a thing of high merit, and that was, the
          character of the chief of their gods, Merodach.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We see something
          of the reverence of the Babylonians and Assyrians for their gods in
          almost all of their historical inscriptions, and there is hardly a
          single communication of the nature of a letter that does not call
          down blessings from them upon the person to whom it is addressed.
          In many a hymn and pious expression they show in what honour they
          held them, and their desire not to offend them, even involuntarily,
          is visible in numerous inscriptions that have been found.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here the text
          breaks off, but sufficient of it remains to show of what the
          devotion of the Babylonians and Assyrians to their gods consisted,
          and what their beliefs really were. For some reason or other, the
          writer recognizes that the divinity whom he worships is displeased
          with him, and apparently comes to the conclusion that the consort
          of the god is displeased also. He therefore prays and humbles
          himself before them, asking that his misdeeds may be forgotten, and
          that he may be separated from his sins, by which he feels himself
          to be bound and fettered. He imagines to himself that the seven
          winds, or a little bird, or a fish, or a beast of the field, or the
          waters of a stream, may carry his sin away, and that the flowing
          waters of the river may cleanse him from his sin, making him pure
          in the eyes of his god as a chain of gold, and precious to him as
          the most precious thing that he can think of, namely, a diamond
          ring (upon such material and worldly similes did the thoughts of
          the Babylonians run). He wishes his life (or his soul—the word in
          the original is <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">napišti</span></span>, which Zimmern
          translates <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Seele</span></span>) to be saved, to pass away
          from his evil state, and to dwell with his god, from whom he begs
          for a sign in the form of a propitious dream, a dream that shall
          come true, showing that he is in reality once more in the favour of
          his god, who, he hopes, will deliver him into the gracious hands of
          the merciful Merodach, that he and all his city may praise his
          great divinity.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Fragment though
          it be, in its beginning, development, and climax, it is, to all
          intents and purposes, perfect, and a worthy specimen of
          compositions of this class.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is noteworthy
          that the suppliant almost re-echoes <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the words of the Psalmist in those passages
          where he speaks of his guarding the court of the temple of his god
          and dwelling in his temple (Ê-sagila, the renowned temple at
          Babylon), wherein, along with other deities, the god Merodach was
          worshipped—the merciful one, into whose gracious hands he wished to
          be delivered. The prayer that his sin might be carried away by a
          bird, or a fish, etc., brings up before the mind's eye the picture
          of the scapegoat, fleeing, laden with the sins of the pious
          Israelite, into the desert to Azazel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all
          appearance, the worshipper, in the above extract, desires to be
          delivered by the god whom he worships into the hands of the god
          Merodach. This is a point that is worthy of notice, for it seems to
          show that the Babylonians, at least in later times, regarded the
          other deities in the light of mediators with the chief of the
          Babylonian Pantheon. As manifestations of him, they all formed part
          of his being, and through them the suppliant found a channel to
          reconciliation and forgiveness of his sins.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this there
          seems to be somewhat of a parallel to the Egyptian belief in the
          soul, at death, being united with Osiris. The annihilation of self,
          however, did not, in all probability, recommend itself to the
          Babylonian mind any more than it must have done to the mind of the
          Assyrian. To all appearance, the preservation of one's
          individuality, in the abodes of bliss after death, was with them an
          essential to the reality of that life beyond the grave. If we adopt
          here Zimmern's translation of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">napišti</span></span> by <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“soul,”</span> the necessity of interpreting the above
          passage in the way here indicated seems to be rendered all the
          greater.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Creation
          legend shows us how the god Merodach was regarded by the
          Babylonians as having attained his high position among the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“gods his fathers,”</span> and the
          reverence that they had for this deity is not only testified to by
          that legend, but also by the many documents of a religious nature
          that exist. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg
          054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          This being the case, it is only natural to suppose, that he would
          be worshipped both under the name of Merodach, his usual
          appellation, and also under any or all of the other names that were
          attributed to him by the Babylonians as having been conferred upon
          him by the gods at the time of his elevation to the position of
          their chief.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Not only,
          therefore, was he called Marduk (Amaruduk, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the brightness of day”</span>), the Hebrew Merodach,
          but he bore also the names of Asaru or Asari, identified by the
          Rev. C. J. Ball and Prof. Hommel with the Egyptian Osiris—a name
          that would tend to confirm what is stated above concerning the
          possible connection between the Egyptian and Babylonian beliefs in
          the immortality of the soul. This name Asaru was compounded with
          various other (explanatory) epithets, making the fuller names
          Asari-lu-duga (probably <span class="tei tei-q">“Asari, he who is
          good”</span>), Asari-lu-duga-namsuba (<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Asari, he who is good, the charm”</span>),
          Asari-lu-duga-namtî (<span class="tei tei-q">“Asari, he who is
          good, the life”</span>), Asari-alima (<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Asari, the prince”</span>), Asari-alima-nuna
          (<span class="tei tei-q">“Asari, the prince, the mighty
          one”</span>), etc., all showing the estimation in which he was
          held, and testifying to the sacredness of the first component,
          which, as already remarked, has been identified with the name of
          Osiris, the chief divinity of the Egyptians. Among his other names
          are (besides those quoted from the last tablet of the story of the
          Creation and the explanatory list that bears upon it) some of
          apparently foreign origin, among them being Amaru (? short for
          Amar-uduk) and Sal-ila, the latter having a decidedly western
          Semitic look.<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href=
          "#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a> As
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the warrior,”</span> he seems to have
          borne the name of Gušur (? <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          strong”</span>); another of his Akkadian appellations was Gudibir,
          and as <span class="tei tei-q">“lord”</span> of all the world he
          was called Bêl, the equivalent of the Baal of the Phœnicians
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name=
          "Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and the Beel of the
          Aramæans. In astronomy his name was given to several stars, and he
          was identified with the planet Jupiter, thus making him the
          counterpart of the Greek and Latin Zeus or Jove.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As has been said
          above, Merodach was the god that was regarded by the Babylonians
          and Assyrians as he who went about doing good on behalf of mankind.
          If he saw a man in affliction—suffering, for instance, from any
          malady—he would go and ask his father Aa, he who knew all things,
          and who had promised to impart all his knowledge to his royal son,
          what the man must do to be cured of the disease or relieved of the
          demon which troubled him. The following will give some idea of what
          the inscriptions detailing these charms and incantations, which the
          god was supposed to obtain from his father, were like—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The numerous
          incantations of this class, in which the god Merodach is
          represented as playing the part of benefactor to the sick and
          afflicted among mankind, and interesting himself in their welfare,
          are exceedingly numerous, and cover a great variety of maladies and
          misfortunes. No wonder, therefore, that the Babylonians looked upon
          the god, their own god, with eyes of affection, and worship, and
          reverence. Indeed, it is doubtful whether the Hebrews themselves,
          the most God-fearing nation of their time, looked upon the God of
          their fathers with as much affection, or reverence, as did the
          Babylonians regard the god Merodach. They show it not only in the
          inscriptions of the class quoted above, but also in numerous other
          texts. All the kings of Babylonia, and not a few of those of
          Assyria, with one consent pay him homage, and testify to their
          devotion. The names of princes and common people, too, often bear
          witness to the veneration that they felt for this, the chief of
          their gods. <span class="tei tei-q">“Merodach is lord of the
          gods,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Merodach is master of the
          word,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“With Merodach is
          life,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“The dear one of the gods is

          Merodach,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Be gracious to me, O
          Merodach,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Direct me, O
          Merodach,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Merodach
          protects,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“Merodach has given a
          brother”</span> (Marduk-nadin-aḫi, the name of one of
          Nebuchadrezzar's sons), <span class="tei tei-q">“A judge is
          Merodach,”</span> etc., etc., are some of the names compounded with
          that of this popular divinity. Merodach was not so much in use, as
          the component part of a name, as the god of wisdom, Nebo, but it is
          not by any means improbable that this is due to the reverence in
          which he was held, which must, at times, have led the more devout
          to avoid the pronunciation of his name any more than was necessary,
          though, if that was the case, it never reached the point of an
          utter prohibition against its utterance, such as caused the
          pronunciation of the Hebrew Yahwah to become <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> entirely lost even to the most learned
          for many hundred years. Those, therefore, who wished to avoid the
          profanation, by too frequent utterance, of this holy name, could
          easily do so by substituting the name of some other deity, for, as
          we have seen above, the names of all the gods could be applied to
          him, and the doctrine of their identification with him only grew in
          strength—we know not under what influence—as time went on, until
          Marduk or Merodach became synonymous with the word <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">îlu</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“God,”</span> and is even used as such in a list where
          the various gods are enumerated as his manifestations. The portion
          of the tablet in question containing these advanced ideas is as

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As this tablet
          is not complete, there is every probability that the god Merodach
          was identified, on the lost portion, with at least as many deities
          as appear on the part that time has preserved to us.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This
          identification of deities with each other would <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> seem to have been a far from uncommon
          thing in the ancient East during those heathen times. A large
          number of deities of the Babylonian Pantheon are identified, in the
          Assyrian proper names, with a very interesting divinity whose name
          appears as Aa, and which may possibly turn out to be only one of
          the many forms that are met with of the god Ya'u or Jah, who was
          not only worshipped by the Hebrews, but also by the Assyrians,
          Babylonians, Hittites, and other nations of the East in ancient
          times. Prof. Hommel, the well-known Assyriologist and Professor of
          Semitic languages at Munich, suggests that this god Yâ is another
          form of the name of Ea, which is possible, but any assimilation of
          the two divinities is probably best explained upon the supposition
          that the people of the East in ancient times identified them with
          each other in consequence of the likeness between the two
          names.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In any case, the
          identification of a large number of the gods—perhaps all of
          them—with a deity whose name is represented by the group Aa, is
          quite certain. Thus we have Aššur-Aa, Ninip-Aa, Bel-Aa, Nergal-Aa,
          Šamaš-Aa, Nusku-Aa, Sin-Aa, etc., and it is probable that the list
          might be greatly extended. Not only, however, have we a large
          number of deities identified with Aa, but a certain number of them
          are also identified with the deity known as Ya, Ya'u, or Au, the
          Jah of the Hebrews. Among these may be cited Bêl-Yau, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Bel is Jah,”</span> Nabû-Yâ', <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Nebo is Jah,”</span> Aḫi-Yau, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Aḫi is Jah,”</span> a name that would seem to confirm
          the opinion which Fuerst held, that <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">aḫi</span></span> was, in this connection, a
          word for <span class="tei tei-q">“god,”</span> or a god. In
          Ya-Dagunu, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jah is Dagon,”</span> we have
          the elements reversed, showing a wish to identify Jah with Dagon,
          rather than Dagon with Jah, whilst another interesting name, Au-Aa,
          shows an identification of Jah with Aa, two names which have every
          appearance of being etymologically connected.</p><span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is then
          but little doubt that we have in these names an indication of an
          attempt at what may be regarded as concentration—a desire and
          tendency towards monotheism. When this began, and what the real
          opinions of the more thoughtful upon the subject of the unity or
          the plurality of the deity may have been, we have at present no
          means of finding out. There can be no doubt, however, that it
          sprang from more than one cause—the desire not to offend either
          heavenly or earthly powers by seeming to favour one divinity more
          than another, the difficulty of dividing and apportioning the
          domain in nature of every divinity, the wish to identify the divine
          patrons of the various nationalities with a view to understanding
          what they really were, and describing their nature for either
          religious or political purposes—all these things, and probably
          others, would tend to counteract not only polytheistic bigotry, but
          also the exclusive appropriation by one tribe or people of any
          particular divinity, who was their own special helper against their
          enemies, and to whose particular protection they defiantly laid
          claim. When in conflict or in dispute with another, there is no
          doubt that the man bearing the name of Šamaš-nûri, for instance,
          would be met with the fierce taunt, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          Sun-god is not more thy light than he is mine,”</span> and, as an
          answer to Yâ-abî-ni, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jah is our father
          too, and more so than he is yours,”</span> would at once spring to
          the lips of any Jew with whom the bearer of the name may have had a
          dispute.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the
          thoughtful, God was one, and all the various gods of the heathen
          were but His manifestations, misconceived and misunderstood by the
          ignorant and thoughtless, but, rightly regarded, full of deep
          significance. The Jews in later times had, in all probability, no
          tendency to polytheism, yet it is certain that they had but little
          objection to bearing heathen names, and of all the examples that
          might be adduced, there is probably not one that is more noteworthy
          than <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name=
          "Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Mordecai, or
          Mardecai, the worshipper of Merodach as typical of the God beside
          whom there was none other, of whom, as we have seen,—and that from
          a Babylonian tablet,—all the other deities of the Babylonian
          Pantheon were but manifestations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the primitive
          deity of the Babylonian Pantheon, and as apparently closely
          identified with the well-known deity Jah, who was worshipped by a
          large section of the Semitic nations, and whose name is one of the
          words for <span class="tei tei-q">“god”</span> in the
          Assyro-Babylonian language, the god Ea, Ae, or Aa, deserves notice
          here not only on account of his being the creator of all the gods,
          but also on account of his fatherhood to Merodach, who, in
          Babylonian mythology, was conceived as supplanting him—not by any
          unfair means, but by the right of being the fittest to exercise
          power and dominion over the world, the universe, and even over
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the gods his fathers.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Assyriologists
          early recognized the attributes of the god whose name they then
          read Hea. They saw that he was regarded by the ancient Babylonians
          and Assyrians as the god of streams, rivers, seas, and the watery
          abyss of the under-world—the waters under the earth. Of the god Ae
          or Ea all sorts of wonderful stories were told by the Babylonians,
          who attributed to him, as the god of wisdom and knowledge, the
          origin of the civilization which they enjoyed. His name, as god of
          deep wisdom, was Nin-igi-azaga, <span class="tei tei-q">“the lord
          of the bright eye,”</span> a name which would seem to show that the
          Akkadians (the names of most of the deities of the
          Assyro-Babylonian Pantheon are written in Akkadian) associated, as
          we also do at the present day, intelligence with brightness of the
          eyes, or, more correctly, with alertness of appearance.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But this god had
          many other names than those <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the sea was
          the abode of the god of knowledge seems to have been the belief of
          the Babylonians from the earliest times. According to Berosus,
          whose record has been preserved by Apollodoros, Abydenus, and
          Alexander Polyhistor, there appeared more than once, from the
          Erythræan Sea (the Persian Gulf), <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          Musaros Oannes, the Annedotos,”</span> a creature half man and half
          fish, probably conceived in shape of the deity <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> answering to this description found on
          certain Babylonian cylinder-seals, in a sculpture with
          representations of marine monsters, now preserved in the Louvre,
          and in the divine figures in the shape of a man clothed with a
          fish's skin, preserved in the form of clay statuettes and large
          sculptures (bas-reliefs) in the British Museum. Abydenus apparently
          understands Berosus differently, for he makes Annedotos and Oannes
          to be different personages. All those who have quoted Berosus,
          however, agree in the main point, that these beings, half man and
          half fish, came out of the sea to teach mankind. There is hardly
          any doubt that in some of these cases the deity that is intended is
          the god whose name is now read Ae or Ea, who was called Aos by
          Damascius. After the appearance of the fourth Annedotos, there came
          another person, also from the Erythræan Sea, named Odakon, having,
          like the former, the same complicated form, between a man and a
          fish. To these names Abydenus, still quoting Berosus, adds those of
          four more <span class="tei tei-q">“double-shaped personages”</span>
          named Euedocos, Eneugamos, Eneuboulos, and Anementos. These last
          came forth in the reign of Daos (probably Dumuzi (Duwuzi) or
          Tammuz) the shepherd, of Pantibiblon (Sippar or Sippara), who
          reigned for the space of ten sari (360,000 years)! <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“After these things was Anodaphos, in the time of
          Euedoreschos.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides his son
          Merodach, who, in Babylonian mythology, became <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“king of the gods,”</span>—like Jupiter, in the place
          of his father—Ae or Ea was regarded as having six other sons,
          Dumu-zi-abzu, <span class="tei tei-q">“Tammuz of the abyss”</span>;
          Ki-gulla, <span class="tei tei-q">“the destroyer of the
          world”</span>; Nira (meaning doubtful); Bara, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the revealer”</span> (?); Bara-gula, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the great revealer (?)”</span>; and Burnunta-sā,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the broad of ear.”</span> One daughter is
          attributed to him, her name being Ḫi-dimme-azaga, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the glorious spirit's offspring,”</span> called, in
          one of the incantations (W.A.I. iv., 2nd ed., col. ii., line 54),
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the daughter of <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the abyss.”</span> He had also two bull-like
          guardians (probably those composite creatures, winged bulls with
          human heads, representations of which guarded the approaches to the
          Assyrian palaces), one seemingly named Duga, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the good,”</span> and the other Dub-ga, apparently
          meaning <span class="tei tei-q">“he who causes (the bolt) to be
          raised,”</span> giving the suppliant access to the palace of his
          lord. To all appearance, the gates giving access to his domain were
          guarded by eight porters, the names of most of whom are
          unfortunately broken away on the tablet that gives these details,
          but one of them seems to have borne the name of Eniw-ḫengala,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the bespeaker of fertility,”</span> whilst
          another was named Igi-ḫen(?)gala, <span class="tei tei-q">“the eye
          of fertility,”</span> and the third had a name beginning, like that
          of the first, with the element Eniw, a circumstance which would
          lead one to ask whether this may not be the element Eneu found in
          the names of the two creatures Eneugamos and Eneuboulos, mentioned
          by Berosus.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His consort was
          called Damkina, <span class="tei tei-q">“the lady of the
          earth,”</span> the Dauké of Damascius, or Dam-gala-nuna,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the great princely lady.”</span> She
          likewise had two bull-like attendants, A-eru and E-a-eru, of whom
          but little or nothing is known.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tablet
          already quoted (W.A.I. iv., pl. 1, col. ii., ll. 36-39) names Engur
          (the deep) as being the mother of Ae or Ea, and attributes to him
          another daughter, Nina, with whom the name of Nineveh is apparently
          connected.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Down in the
          Abyss, in the city called Eridu, <span class="tei tei-q">“the good
          city,”</span> there dwelt Ae, with all his court. Sitting on his
          throne, he waited for the time when his son Merodach, the good of
          heart, came to ask him for those health-bringing incantations for
          the benefit of mankind. Sometimes, seemingly, instead of Merodach,
          his sixth son Burnunsia (Burnunta-sā), <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          broad of ear,”</span> would perform this office. Ae was always
          ready to help with his counsels, and no one whose case <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Merodach forwarded was spurned by the
          King of the Abyss.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, too, dwelt
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Tammuz of the Abyss,”</span> one of Ae's
          sons, but whether this was the well-known Tammuz who was the
          husband of the goddess Ishtar, is uncertain. Judging from the
          legends of the Babylonians, Ishtar's husband descended, not to the
          abode of the lord of the deep, but to the realms of the Babylonian
          Persephone, the consort of Nergal, in Hades, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the land of no return,”</span> whither Ishtar once
          descended in search of him. Concerning the Babylonian paradise,
          where Ae dwelt, see the following chapter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second month
          of the Babylonian year, Iyyar, corresponding to April—May, was
          dedicated to Ae as lord of mankind, though in this the records
          contradict each other, for the Creation-stories of the Babylonians
          attribute the creation of mankind to Merodach, who has, therefore,
          the best right to be regarded as their lord.</p>

          <span class="tei tei-q">“host of earth,”</span> are, it will be
          remembered, given in the Semitic Babylonian account of the Creation
          as the names of the powers that succeeded Laḫmu and Laḫamu,
          according to Damascius, the second progeny of the sea and the deep
          (Tiamtu and Apsū). The Greek forms, Assoros and Kisaré, imply that
          Damascius understood the former to be masculine and the latter
          feminine, though there is no hint of gender in the wedge-written
          records. That the Babylonians regarded them as being of different
          genders, however, is conceivable enough. The Greek form of the
          first, Assoros, moreover, implies that, in course of time, the
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">n</span></span> of Anšar became assimilated
          with the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">š</span></span> (as was usual in Semitic
          Babylonian), and on account of this, the etymology that connects
          Anšar with the name <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg
          066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of the Assyrian national god Aššur, is not without justification,
          though whether it be preferable to that of Delitzsch which makes
          Aššur to be really Ašur, and connects it with <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ašaru</span></span>, meaning <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“holy,”</span> is doubtful. In favour of Delitzsch,
          however, is the fact that the Assyrians would more probably have
          given their chief divinity the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          Holy one”</span> than that of one of the links in the chain of
          divinities which culminated in the rise of the god Merodach to the
          highest place in the kingdom of heaven.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question
          naturally arises: Who were these deities, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the host of heaven”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the host of earth”</span>? and this is a question to
          which we do not get a very complete answer from the inscriptions.
          According to the explanatory lists of gods (as distinct from the
          mythological texts proper) Kišar is explained as the <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“host of heaven and earth”</span> and also as Anu and
          Antum, in other words, as the male and female personifications of
          the heavens. Strange to say, this is just the explanation given in
          the inscriptions of the names Laḫmu and Laḫamu, for though they are
          not <span class="tei tei-q">“the host of heaven and earth,”</span>
          they are the same, according to the lists of gods, as the deities
          Anu and his consort Antum. This probably arises from the worship of
          Anu, the god of the heavens, and his consort, at some period
          preceding that of the worship of Merodach, or even that of his
          father Aa or Ea, whose cult, as we have seen, was in early times
          abandoned for that of the patron god of the city of Babylon.
          Concerning this portion of the legend of the Creation, however,
          much more light is required.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
          simple form Kišar, there occurs in the lists of gods also
          Kišaragala, which is likewise explained as a manifestation of Anu
          and Antum, and described moreover as <span class="tei tei-q">“Anu,
          who is the host (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kiššat</span></span>) of heaven and
          earth.”</span> In addition to Anšar and <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Kišar, the deities Enšara and Ninšara are
          mentioned. These names are apparently to be translated <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“lord of the host”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“lady of the host”</span> respectively, and are
          doubtless both closely connected with, or the same as, the Anšar
          and Kišar of the Babylonian story of the Creation, in close
          connection with which they are, in fact, mentioned. En-kišara is
          given, in W.A.I., III., pl. 68, as one of the three <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mu-gala</span></span> (apparently <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“great names”</span>) of Anu, the god of the heavens.
          Another Nin-šara (the second element written with a different
          character) is given as the equivalent of both Antum and Ištar, the
          latter being the well-known goddess of love and war, Venus.</p>

          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></span>,
          a phenomenon that also meets us in other words having a nasal
          before the dental. As this word is the Tauthé of the Greek writer
          Damascius, it is clear that in his time the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">m</span></span>
          was pronounced as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">w</span></span> (this peculiarity is common to
          the Semitic Babylonian and Akkadian languages, and finds its
          converse illustration in the provincialism of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mir</span></span> for <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">wir</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“we,”</span> in German), though the decayed word
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tâmtu</span></span> evidently kept its labial
          unchanged, for it is difficult to imagine <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">w</span></span>
          changing <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">t</span></span> into <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>,
          unless it were pronounced in a way to which wee are not accustomed.
          We have here, then, an example of a differentiation by which one
          and the same word, by a change of pronunciation, forms two
          <span class="tei tei-q">“vocables,”</span> the one used as a proper
          noun and the other—a more decayed form—as a common one.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tiamtu (from the
          above it may be supposed that the real pronunciation was as
          indicated by the Greek form, namely, Tiauthu), meaning originally
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the sea,”</span> <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> became then the personification of the watery
          deep as the producer of teeming animal life such as we find in the
          waters everywhere. Dominating and covering at first the whole
          earth, it was she who was the first producer of living things, but
          when the land appeared, and creatures of higher organization and
          intelligence began, under the fostering care of the higher
          divinities, to make their appearance, she saw, so the Babylonians
          seem to have thought, that with the advent of man, whom the gods
          purposed forming, her power and importance would, in a short time,
          disappear, and rebellion on her part was the result. How, in the
          Babylonian legends, this conflict ended, the reader of the
          foregoing pages knows, and after her downfall and destruction or
          subjugation, she retained her productive power under the immediate
          control and direction of the gods under whose dominion she had
          fallen.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tiamtu is
          represented in the Old Testament by <span lang="he" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">tehôm</span></span>, which occurs in Gen. i.
          2, where both the Authorised and Revised Versions translate
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the deep.”</span> The Hebrew form of the
          word, however, is not quite the same, the Assyrian feminine ending
          being absent.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all
          appearance the legend of Tiamtu was well known all over Western
          Asia. As Gunkel and Zimmern have shown, there is a reference
          thereto in Ps. lxxxix. 10, where Rahab, who was broken in pieces,
          is referred to, and under the same name she appears also in Isaiah
          li. 9, with the additional statement that she is the dragon who was
          pierced; likewise in Job xxvi. 12 and ix. 13, where her followers
          are said to be referred to; in Ps. lxxiv. 14 the dragon whose heads
          (a plural probably typifying the diverse forms under which Nature's
          creative power appears) are spoken of. Tiamtu, as Rahab and the
          dragon, therefore played a part in Hebrew legends of old as great,
          perhaps, as in the mythology of Babylonia, where she seems to have
          originated.</p>

        every pleasant and good tree to grow, including the tree of life, and
        the tree of knowledge of good and evil. A river came out of Eden to
        water the garden, and this river was afterwards divided into four
        smaller streams, the Pishon, flowing round <span class=

        that it was not the garden itself that was called Eden, but the

        the land of Eden or on its borders.</p>

        the Garden of Eden and its rivers has been so many times discussed,
        and so many diverse opinions prevail concerning them, that there is
        no need at present to add to these theories yet another, more or less
        probable. Indeed, in the present work, theories will be kept in the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It had long been
        known that one of the Akkadian names for <span class=

        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">edina</span></span>, and that that word had been
        borrowed by the Babylonians under the form of <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">êdinnu</span></span>, but it was Prof.
        Delitzsch, the well-known Assyriologist, who first pointed out to a
        disbelieving world that this must be the Eden of Genesis. The present
        writer thought this identification worthless until he had the
        privilege of examining the tablets acquired by Dr. Hayes Ward in
        Babylonia on the occasion of his conducting the Wolfe expedition.
        Among the fragments of tablets that he then brought back was a list
        of cities in the Akkadian language (the Semitic Babylonian column was
        unfortunately broken away) which gave the following—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here at last was
        the word Eden used as a geographical name, showing that the
        explanation of Delitzsch was not only plausible, but also, in all
        probability, true in substance and in fact. Less satisfactory,
        however, were the learned Professor's identifications of the rivers
        of Eden, for he regards the Pishon and the Gihon as canals—the former
        being the Pallacopas (the Pallukatu of the Babylonian inscriptions),
        and the latter the Guḫandê (also called the Araḫtu, now identified
        with a large canal running through Babylon). He conjectured that it
        might be the waterway known as the Shatt en-Nîl. Whatever doubt,
        however, attaches to his identifications of the rivers, he seems
        certainly to be right with regard to the Biblical Eden, and this is a
        decided gain, for it locates the position of that district beyond a
        doubt.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
        introductory lines above translated, we see that Êridu, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the good city,”</span> which Sir Henry Rawlinson
        recognized many years ago as a type of paradise, was, to the
        Babylonians, as a garden of Eden, wherein grew a glorious tree, to
        all appearance a vine, for the adjective <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“dark”</span> may very reasonably be regarded as
        referring to its fruit. Strange must <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> have been its appearance, for it is described
        as resembling <span class="tei tei-q">“white lapis-lazuli,”</span>
        that is, the beautiful stone of that kind mottled blue and white. The
        probability that it was conceived by the Babylonians as a garden is
        strengthened by the fact that the god Aê, and his path, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the
        rivers, filled the place with fertility, and it was, moreover, the
        abode of the river-god Nammu, whose streams, the Tigris and
        Euphrates, flowed on both sides. There, too, dwelt the Sun, making
        the garden fruitful with his ever-vivifying beams, whilst
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the peerless mother of heaven,”</span> as
        Tammuz seems to be called, added, by fructifying showers, to the
        fertility that the two great rivers brought down from the mountains
        from which they flowed. To complete still further the parallel with
        the Biblical Eden, it was represented as a place to which access was
        forbidden, for <span class="tei tei-q">“no man entered its
        midst,”</span> as in the case of the Garden of Eden after the
        fall.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though one cannot
        be dogmatic in the presence of the imperfect records that we possess,
        it is worthy of note that Eden does not occur as the name of the
        earthly paradise in any of the texts referring to the Creation that
        have come down to us; and though it is to be found in the bilingual
        story of the Creation, it there occurs simply as the equivalent of
        the Semitic word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ṣêrim</span></span> in the phrase <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“he (Merodach) made the verdure of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">plain</span></em>.”</span> That we shall
        ultimately find other instances of Eden as a geographical name,
        occurring by itself, and not in composition with another word (as in
        the expression <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Sipar Edina</span></span>), and even a reference
        to <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        pointed out that whilst in Eden the river bears no name, it is only
        after it has left the sacred region that it is divided, and then each
        separate branch received a name. So, also, in the Babylonian
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073"
        id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> description of the Eridu, the
        rivers were unnamed, though one guesses that the Tigris and the
        Euphrates are meant. The expression, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        mouth of the rivers [that are on] both sides”</span> (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">pî nârãti ...
        kilallan</span></span>), recalls to the mind the fact, that it was to
        <span class="tei tei-q">“a remote place at the mouth of the
        rivers”</span> that the Babylonian Noah (Pir-napištim) was translated
        after the Flood, when the gods conferred upon him the gift of
        immortality. To all appearance, therefore, Gilgameš, the ancient
        Babylonian hero who visited the immortal sage, entered into the tract
        regarded by the Babylonians of old times as being set apart for the
        abode of the blessed after their journeyings on this world should
        cease.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The connection of
        the stream which was <span class="tei tei-q">“the path of Ae”</span>
        with Eridu, seems to have been very close, for in the bilingual story
        of the Creation the flowing of the stream is made to be the immediate

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this Babylonian
        Creation-story it is a question of a stream and two rivers. In
        Genesis it is a question of a river and four branches. The
        parallelism is sufficiently close to be noteworthy and to show,
        beyond a doubt, that the Babylonians had the same accounts of the
        Creation and descriptions of the circumstances concerning it, as the
        Hebrews, though told in a different way, and in a different
        connection.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two trees are
        mentioned in the Biblical account of the Creation, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the tree of life”</span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.”</span> By
        the eating of the former, a man would live for ever, and the latter
        would confer upon him that knowledge which God <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> alone was supposed to possess, namely, of
        good and evil, carrying with it, however, the disadvantage of the
        loss of that innocence which he formerly possessed. Like the Hebrews,
        the Babylonians and Assyrians also had their sacred trees, but
        whether they attached to them the same deep significance as the
        Hebrews did to theirs we do not know. Certain, however, it is, that
        they had beliefs concerning them that were analogous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The most familiar
        form of the sacred tree is that employed by the Assyrians, to a
        certain extent as a decorative ornament, on the sculptured slabs that
        adorned the walls of the royal palaces. This was the curious
        conglomeration of knots and leaves which various figures—winged genii
        with horned hats emblematic of divinity, eagle-headed figures,
        etc.—worship, and to which they make offerings, and touch with a
        conical object resembling the fruit of the fir or pine. An ingenious
        suggestion has been made to the effect that the genius with the
        pine-cone is represented in the act of fructifying the tree with the
        pollen (in an idealized form) from the flowers of another tree, just
        as it is necessary to fructify the date-palm from the pollen of the
        flowers growing on the <span class="tei tei-q">“male”</span> tree.
        This, however, can hardly be the true explanation of the mystic act
        represented, as similar genii are shown on other slabs not only
        holding out the conical object as if to touch therewith the figure of
        the king, but also doing the same thing to the effigies of the great
        winged bulls. Of course, the fructification of the king would be not
        only a possible representation to carve in alabaster, but one that we
        might even expect to find among the royal sculptures. The
        fructification of a winged bull, however, is quite a different thing,
        and in the highest degree improbable, unless the divine bull were a
        kind of representation of the king, which, though possible, is at
        present unprovable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This symbolic
        scene, therefore, remains still a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> mystery for scholars to explain when they
        obtain the material to do so. It seems to be a peculiarly Assyrian
        design, for the offering of a pine-cone or similarly-shaped object to
        the sacred tree has not yet been found in Babylonian art. The
        Babylonian sacred tree is, moreover, a much more natural-looking
        object than the curious combination of knots and honeysuckle-shaped
        flowers found in the sculptures of Assyria. As in the case of the
        tree shown in the picture of the Temptation, described below, the
        sacred tree of the Babylonians often takes the form of a palm-tree,
        or something very like one. (See pl. <a href="#Plate_III" class=
        "tei tei-ref">III</a>.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As has been
        already remarked, the tree of Paradise of the Babylonians was, to all
        appearance, a vine, described as being in colour like blue and white
        mottled lapis-lazuli, and apparently bearing fruit (grapes) of a dark
        colour. That the Babylonian tree of life was a vine is supported by
        the fact that the ideograms composing the word for <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“wine”</span> are <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">geš-tin</span></span> (for <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kaš-tin</span></span>), <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“drink of life,”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        vine,”</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">giš geš-tin</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“tree of the drink of life.”</span> In the text
        describing the Babylonian Paradise and its divine tree, the name of
        the latter is given as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kiškanû</span></span> in Semitic, and
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">giš-kin</span></span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">giš-kan</span></span> in Akkadian, a word
        mentioned in the bilingual lists among plants of the vine species.
        Whether the Hebrews regarded the tree of life as having been a vine
        or not, cannot at present be decided, but it is very probable that
        they had the same ideas as the Babylonians in the matter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is noteworthy,
        in this connection, that the Babylonians also believed that there
        still existed in the world a plant (they do not seem to have regarded
        it as a tree) which <span class="tei tei-q">“would make an old man
        young again.”</span> Judging from the statements concerning it, one
        would imagine that it was a kind of thorn-bush. As we shall see
        later, when treating of the story of the Flood, it was this plant
        which the Chaldean Noah gave the hero Gilgameš instructions how to
        find—for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg
        076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the
        desire to become young again had seized him—and he seems to have
        succeeded in possessing himself of it, only to lose it again almost
        immediately, for a lion, coming that way at a time when Gilgameš was
        otherwise occupied, carried it off—to his own benefit, as the hero
        remarks, for he naturally supposed that the lion who had seized the
        plant would have his life renewed, and prey all the longer upon the
        people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The title of a
        lost legend, <span class="tei tei-q">“When the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kiškanû</span></span> (? vine, see above) grew
        in the land”</span> (referring, perhaps, to the tree of life which
        grew in Êridu), leads one to ask whether <span class="tei tei-q">“The
        legend of Nisaba (the corn-deity) and the date-palm,”</span> and
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The legend of the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">luluppu</span></span>-tree”</span> may not also
        refer to sacred trees, bearing upon the question of the tree of
        knowledge referred to in Gen. ii. As, however, the titles (generally
        a portion of the first line only) are all that are at present
        preserved, there is nothing to be done but wait patiently until it
        pleases Providence to make them further known to us.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kiškanû</span></span> was of three kinds, white
        (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">piṣu</span></span>), black (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ṣalmi</span></span>), as in the description of
        the tree of Paradise, and grey or blue (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">sâmi</span></span>). In view of there being
        these three colours, it would seem that they refer rather to the
        fruit of the tree than to the tree itself. Now the only plant growing
        in the country and having these three colours of fruit, is the vine.
        Of course, this raises the question whether (1) the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kiškanû</span></span> is a synonym of
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">gištin</span></span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">karanu</span></span>, or (2) the word
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">gištin</span></span>, which is generally
        rendered <span class="tei tei-q">“vine,”</span> is, in reality,
        correctly translated. Whatever be the true explanation, one thing is
        certain, namely, that in the description of Paradise, the word black
        or dark (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ṣalmu</span></span>), applied to the tree there
        mentioned, cannot refer to the tree itself, for that is described as
        being like <span class="tei tei-q">“white lapis”</span> (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">uknū
        êbbu</span></span>), a beautiful stone mottled blue and white.</p>

        mentioned in an inscription of a religious or ceremonial nature,
        though exactly in what connection the imperfectness of the document
        does not enable us to see. It would seem, however, that there were
        certain priests or seers to whom was confided the <span class=

        heavens and earth (probably the <span class="tei tei-q">“tablet of
        fate,”</span> which Merodach took from the husband of Tiamat after
        his fight with her for the dominion of the universe). These persons,
        who seem to have been the descendants of En-we-dur-an-ki (the
        Euedoranchos of Berosus), king of Sippar, were those to whom was
        confided <span class="tei tei-q">“the cedar beloved of the great
        gods”</span>—perhaps a kind of sceptre. They had, however, not only
        to be of noble race, but also perfect physically and free from every
        defect and disease. Moreover, one who did not keep the command of
        Šamaš and Addu (Hadad) could not approach the place of Ae, Šamaš,
        Marduk, and Nin-edina, nor the number of the brothers who were to
        enter the seership; they were not to reveal to him the word of the
        oracle, and <span class="tei tei-q">“the cedar beloved of the great

          <span class="tei tei-q">“the created one.”</span> This etymology is
          that put forward by the Assyriologist Fried. Delitzsch, who quotes
          the Assyrian <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          "font-style: italic">udumu</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“monkey,”</span> to the same root. He also quotes,
          apparently from memory, the evidence of a fragment of a bilingual
          list found by Mr. Rassam, in which Adam is explained by the usual
          Babylonian word for <span class="tei tei-q">“man,”</span>
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          In all probability, the Babylonians had the same legends, but, if
          so, no fragment of them has as yet come to light. That the Hebrew
          stories of the Creation had their origin in Babylonia, will
          probably be conceded by most people as probable, if not actually
          proven, and the fact that the word <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">a-dam</span></span> occurs, as Delitzsch has
          pointed out, in a bilingual list would, supposing the text to which
          he refers to be actually bilingual, be a matter of peculiar
          significance, for it would show that this word, which does not
          occur in Semitic Babylonian as the word for <span class=

          number of men, in this passage something like community, for that
          is the idea which best fits the context. But besides this Semitic

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The possibility
          that the Babylonians had an account of the Fall similar to that of
          the Hebrews, is not only suggested by the legends treated of above,
          but also by the cylinder-seal in the British Museum with what seems
          to be the representation of the Temptation engraved upon it. We
          have there presented to us the picture of a tree—a palm—bearing
          fruit, and on each side of it a seated figure, that on the right
          being to all appearance the man, and that on the left the woman,
          though there is not much difference between them, and, as far as
          the form of either goes, the sexes might easily be reversed. That,
          however, which seems to be intended for the man has the horned hat
          emblematic of divinity, or, probably, of divine origin, whilst from
          the figure which seems to be that of the woman this head-dress is
          absent. Behind her, moreover, with wavy body standing erect on his
          tail, is shown the serpent, towering just above her head, as if
          ready to speak with her. Both figures are stretching out a hand
          (the man the right, the woman the left) as if to pluck the fruit
          growing on the tree. Notwithstanding the doubts that have been
          thrown on the explanation here given of this celebrated and
          exceedingly interesting cylinder, the subject and its arrangement
          are so suggestive, that one can hardly regard it as being other
          than what it seems to be, namely, a Babylonian representation of
          the Temptation, according to records <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page080">[pg 080]</span><a name="Pg080" id="Pg080" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> that the Babylonians possessed. The date of
          this object may be set down as being from about 2750 to 2000

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Future
          excavations in Babylonia and Assyria will, no doubt, furnish us
          with the legends current in those countries concerning the
          Temptation, the Fall, and the sequel thereto. Great interest would
          naturally attach to the Babylonian rendering of the details and
          development of the story, more particularly to the terms of the
          penalty, the expulsion, and the nature of the beings—the
          cherubim—placed at the east of the garden, and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the flaming sword turning every way, to keep the way
          of the tree of life.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though the
          Babylonian version of this Biblical story has not yet come to
          light, the inscriptions in the wedge-writing give us a few details
          bearing upon the word <span class="tei tei-q">“cherub.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hebrews
          understood these celestial beings as having the form which we
          attribute to angels—a glorified human appearance, but with the
          addition of wings. They are spoken of as bearing the throne of the
          Almighty through the clouds (<span class="tei tei-q">“He rode upon
          a cherub, and did fly”</span>), and in Psalm xviii. 11 he is also
          represented as sitting upon them. In Ezekiel i. and x. they are
          said to be of a very composite form, combining with the human shape
          the face of a cherub (whatever that may have been), a man, an ox, a
          lion, and an eagle. It has been supposed that Ezekiel was indebted
          to Assyro-Babylonian imagery for the details of the cherubic
          creatures that he describes, but it may safely be said that, though
          the sculptures furnish us with images of divine creatures in the
          form of a man with the face of an eagle, or having a modification
          of a lion's head, and bulls and lions with the faces of men, there
          has never yet been found a figure provided with a wheel for the
          purpose of locomotion, and having four heads, like those of which
          the prophet speaks. We may, therefore, safely conclude, that
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page081">[pg 081]</span><a name=
          "Pg081" id="Pg081" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Ezekiel applied the
          word <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
          "he"><span style="font-style: italic">kerûb</span></span> (cherub)
          to the creatures that he saw in his vision, because that was the
          most suitable word he could find, not because it was the term
          usually applied to things of that kind. It is hardly likely that
          the guardians of the entrance into the earthly Paradise and the
          creatures that bore up the throne of the Almighty were conceived as
          being of so complicated a form as the cherubim of Ezekiel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever doubt
          may exist as to the original form of this celestial being, the
          discussion of the origin of the Hebrew word <span lang="he" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kerûb</span></span> may now be regarded as
          finally settled by the discovery of the Assyro-Babylonian records.
          It is undoubtedly borrowed from the Babylonian <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kirubu</span></span>, a word meaning simply
          <span class="tei tei-q">“spirit,”</span> and conceived as one who
          was always in the presence (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ina

          (qoph) to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          Babylonian, and occurs more frequently before <em class=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i</span></em>, hence the form in Hebrew,
          <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kerûb</span></span> (cherub—the translators
          intended that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=

          would have transcribed as <span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Originally the
          Assyro-Babylonian word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">kirubu</span></span> seems to have meant
          something like <span class="tei tei-q">“intimate friend,”</span> or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“familiar,”</span> as in the expression
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          <span class="tei tei-q">“daughter of the king,”</span> and
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the beloved woman of the king.”</span> An
          illustration of its extended meaning of <span class=

          from <span class="tei tei-q">“the tablet of Good

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cherubim
          were therefore the good spirits who performed the will of God, and,
          in the minds of the Assyrians and Babylonians, watched over and
          guarded the man who was the <span class="tei tei-q">“son of his
          God,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the pious man.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The cherub upon
          which the Almighty rode, and upon whom he sat, corresponds more to
          the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">guzalū</span></span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“throne-bearer”</span> of Assyro-Babylonian mythology.
          They were apparently beings who bore up the thrones of the gods,
          and are frequently to be seen in Babylonian sculptures thus
          employed, at rest, and waiting patiently, to all appearance, until
          their divine master, seated on the throne which rests on their
          shoulders, should again give them word, or make known that it was
          now his will to start and journey forth once more.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The story of
          Cain and Abel, and the first tragedy that occurred in the world
          after the creation of man, has always attracted the attention of
          the pious on that account, and because the first recorded murder
          was that of a brother. This is a story to which the discovery of a
          Babylonian parallel was least likely to be found, and, as a matter
          of fact, none has as yet come to light. Notwithstanding this, a few
          remarks upon such remote parallels which exist, and such few
          illustrations of the event that can be found, may be cited in this
          place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These are
          contained in the story of Tammuz or Adonis, who, though not
          supposed to have been slain by his brother, was nevertheless killed
          by the cold of Winter, who might easily have been regarded as his
          brother, for Tammuz typified the season of Summer, the
          Brother-season, so to say, of Winter. As is well known, the name
          Tammuz is Akkadian, and occurs in that language under the form of
          Dumu-zi, or, more fully, Dumu-zida, meaning <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the everlasting son,”</span> in Semitic Babylonian
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">âblu
          kênu</span></span>. It is very noteworthy that Prof. J. Oppert has
          suggested that the name of Abel, in Hebrew Habel, is, in reality,
          none other than <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page083">[pg
          083]</span><a name="Pg083" id="Pg083" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the Babylonian <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ablu</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“son,”</span> and the question naturally arises, May
          not the story of Cain and Abel have given rise to the legend of
          Tammuz, or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ablu kênu</span></span>, as his name would be
          if translated into Semitic Babylonian?</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unless by a
          folk-etymology, however, the Semitic Babylonian translation of the
          name of Tammuz can hardly be a composition of Abel and Cain,
          because the first letter is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">q</span></em> (qoph) and not <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></em>
          (kaph), the transcription Cain for Kain or Kayin being faulty in
          the A.V. Still, we feel bound to recognize that there is a
          possibility, though naturally a remote one, that the legend of
          Tammuz is connected with that of Cain and Abel, just as the
          division of the Dragon (in the Babylonian story of the Creation) by
          the god Merodach into two halves, with one of which he covered the
          heavens, leaving the other below upon the earth, typifies the
          division of the waters above the earth from those below in the
          Biblical story of the same event.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a
          legend, named by me (for want of a more precise title) <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The Lament of the Daughter of the god Sin,”</span> in
          which the carrying off (by death?) of <span class="tei tei-q">“her
          fair son”</span> is referred to. Here we have another possible
          Babylonian parallel to the story of the death of Abel, in which the
          driving forth of her who makes the lament from her city and from
          her palace might well typify the expulsion of Eve from Paradise,
          and her delivery into the power of her enemy, who is, to all
          appearance, the king of terrors, into whose hands she and her
          husband were, for their disobedience, consigned. In this really
          beautiful Babylonian poem her <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“enemy”</span> seems to reproach her, telling her how
          it was she, and she alone, who had ruined herself.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though there may
          be something in the comparisons with the story of Cain and Abel
          which are quoted here, more probably (as has been already remarked)
          there is nothing, and the real parallels have yet to be found. In
          any case, they are instances of the popularity among the
          Babylonians and Assyrians of those stories of one, greatly beloved
          and in the bloom of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg
          084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          youth, coming, like Abel, to an untimely end through the perversity
          of fate, and by no fault of his own. Though neither may be the
          original of the Biblical story nor yet derived from it, they are of
          interest and value as beautiful legends of old time, possibly
          throwing light on the Biblical story.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As yet the
          Babylonian and Assyrian records shed but little light on the
          question of the patriarchs of the early ages succeeding Adam, the
          details that are given concerning them, and their long lives. Upon
          this last point there is only one remark to be made, and that is,
          that the prehistoric kings of Babylonia likewise lived and reigned
          for abnormally long ages, according to the records that have come
          down to us. Unfortunately, there is nothing complete in the
          important original of the Canon of Berosus first published by the
          late G. Smith, and the beginning is especially mutilated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The likeness
          between Enoch and the Akkadian name of the city of Erech, Unug, has
          already been pointed out, and it has been suggested that the two
          words are identical. This, however, can hardly be the case, for the
          Hebrew form of Enoch is Ḫanôḳ, the initial letter being the
          guttural <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ḫeth</span></span>, which, notwithstanding the
          parallel ease of Hiddekel, the Akkadian Idigna (the Tigris),
          weakens the comparison. The principal argument against the
          identification, however, is the fact that, in the bilingual story
          of the Creation, the god Merodach is said to have built the city,
          and such was evidently the Babylonian belief.<a id="noteref_6"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Noah, son of
        Lamech, had reached the age of five hundred years, and had three
        sons, Shem, Ham, and Japhet; and at this time men had begun to
        multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them;
        then <span class="tei tei-q">“the sons of God saw the daughters of
        men that they were fair, and they took them wives of all that they
        chose.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question
        naturally arises, <span class="tei tei-q">“Who were these sons of
        God?”</span> According to Job xxxviii. 7, where we have the statement
        that <span class="tei tei-q">“The morning stars sang together, and
        all the sons of God shouted for joy,”</span> it would seem to be the
        angels that are intended by these words, and this is apparently the
        opinion generally held by scholars and divines on the subject. This
        view seems to be favoured by the Second Epistle of Peter (ii. 1),
        though, as the words do not actually agree with those of the text of
        Genesis quoted above, nothing very positive can be maintained
        concerning the apostle's dictum—in fact, his words in the passage
        referred to, <span class="tei tei-q">“for if God spared not the
        angels that sinned, but cast them down to hell, and delivered them
        into chains and darkness, to be reserved unto <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page086">[pg 086]</span><a name="Pg086" id="Pg086"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> judgment,”</span> can much more
        reasonably be regarded as referring, and therefore giving authority
        to, the story of the fall of the angels, as indicated in Avitus,
        Caedmon, and Milton, a legend of which the germs are found in the
        Babylonian account of the Creation, referred to in Chapter I. The
        other passages of Job where this expression occurs (i. 6, and ii. 2)
        are not conclusive as to the meaning <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“angels,”</span> for the expressions <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“sons of God,”</span> in those passages, who are said to
        have come before the Almighty, may very well have been merely
        men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">However the matter
        may stand, for the passages in Job, there is every probability that
        it is not the angels that are intended in the description we are
        examining as to the reasons of the coming of the Flood. As the late
        George Bertin was the first to point out, the Babylonians often used
        the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“a son of his god,”</span>
        apparently to designate <span class="tei tei-q">“a just man,”</span>
        or something similar. The connection in which this expression occurs
        is as follows—</p>

          </div>
        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this passage
        the phrase in question is (in Akkadian) <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">gišgallu dumu
        dingirana</span></span>, and (in Assyrian) <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">amēlu mâr
        îli-šu</span></span>. It is a frequent expression in documents of
        this class, and always occurs in a similar connection. In some cases,
        instead of <span class="tei tei-q">“the man, the son of his
        god,”</span> the variation <span class="tei tei-q">“the king, the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087"
        id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> son of his god”</span> occurs,
        and is apparently to be paraphrased in the same way, and understood
        as <span class="tei tei-q">“the pious king.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">May it not be,
        then, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the sons of God,”</span> who saw
        that the daughters of men were fair (lit. good), and took of them as
        many wives as they wanted, were those who were regarded as the pious
        men of the time? For who among the angels would at any time have
        thought of allying himself with an earthly and mortal spouse, and
        begetting children—offspring who should turn out to be <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“mighty men which were of old, men of renown,”</span> as
        verse 4 has it? In this case, the <span class="tei tei-q">“daughters
        of men”</span> would be children of common people, not possessing any
        special piety or other virtue to recommend them, the only thing being
        that their daughters were fair, and good enough, in the opinion of
        those <span class="tei tei-q">“sons of God,”</span> to have as their
        wives.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is apparently
        given as the result of these unions between the pious men and the
        daughters of the people that wickedness became rife in the earth, and
        man's imagination continually evil; and this was so to such an extent
        that the Almighty repented of having created man, and decided to
        destroy the wicked generation—both man, and beast, and creeping
        thing, and fowl of the air—dwelling upon the earth—all except Noah,
        who found favour in the eyes of Yahwah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having decided to
        destroy the life of the world by means of a flood, God communicated
        His intention and the reason thereof to the patriarch, and instructed
        him to build an ark in which he was to save both himself and his
        family from the impending destruction. The vessel is to be built of
        gopher-wood, to have rooms in it, and to be pitched within and
        without with pitch. The dimensions also are specified. Its length was
        to be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height
        thirty cubits. He was to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg
        088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        make the ark <span class="tei tei-q">“with light”</span> (צהר or
        רהצ), that is, with windows, and their length or height, apparently,
        was to be a cubit. The vessel was to have a door, and to be built
        with three stories, lower, second, and third. In accordance with
        God's covenant with the patriarch, he, his sons, and his sons' wives
        were to be saved, along with every living thing, male and female of
        each kind. For all this great multitude a sufficiency of food was
        directed to be provided.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then comes the
        command (the ark having been duly built, and all the directions
        followed) to enter into the vessel, and further instructions are
        given with regard to the creatures that are to be saved, with a
        slight modification in the numbers, for the clean beasts are to be
        taken in <span class="tei tei-q">“by sevens,”</span> and all the
        rest, <span class="tei tei-q">“the unclean,”</span> by pairs. God
        then announces that in seven days' time He will cause rain to come
        upon the earth for forty days and forty nights. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“All the fountains of the great deep”</span> were broken
        up, and the Lord shut up those upon whom He had favour in the
        ark.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then, as the rain
        continued, the waters <span class="tei tei-q">“prevailed
        exceedingly”</span> upon the earth, and the high hills that were
        under the whole heaven were covered, the depth of the waters being
        <span class="tei tei-q">“fifteen cubits and upwards.”</span>
        Everything was destroyed, <span class="tei tei-q">“Noah alone
        remained alive, and those who were with him in the ark.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and
        fifty days.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“fountains of the deep”</span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the windows of heaven”</span> having been stopped, and
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“rain from heaven”</span> restrained, the
        waters abated, leaving the ark high and dry upon the mountains of
        Ararat; and after the tops of the mountains were seen, Noah looked
        out of the window that he had made. He then sent forth a raven and a
        dove, and the latter, not finding a resting-place, returned to him,
        to be sent forth again at the end of another week. The dove
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089"
        id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> again returned bearing in her
        beak an olive-leaf. Seven days more passed, and the dove, having been
        sent out a third time, returned to him no more. Recognizing that the
        waters were now all returned into their old channels, and that the
        land was dry enough for him and his, Noah removed the covering of the
        vessel, and saw that his supposition was correct, and having received
        the command to come forth from the ark, which had been his
        abiding-place for so long, and to send forth the living creatures
        that were with him, the patriarch obeyed, and, when on dry land,
        built an altar to Yahwah, and offered burnt offerings thereon of
        every clean beast and every clean fowl.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And the Lord smelled a sweet savour (lit. a savour of
        rest); and the Lord said in His heart, I will not again curse the
        ground any more for man's sake, for the imagination of man's heart is
        evil from his youth.... While the earth remaineth, seedtime and
        harvest, and cold and heat, and summer and winter, and day and night
        shall not cease.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Then comes, in the
        ninth chapter, the blessing of God, with a charge concerning the
        shedding of blood. He makes also a covenant with Noah, by the sign of
        the rainbow, declaring that a like calamity shall never again come
        upon the earth to destroy all life that is upon it.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is, in short,
        the Bible story of the great flood that destroyed, at a remote age of
        the world, all life upon the earth. It is a narrative
        circumstantially told, with day, month, and year all indicated, and
        it forms a good subject for comparison with the Babylonian account,
        with which it agrees so closely in all the main points, and from
        which it differs so much in many essential details.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As in the case of
        the Babylonian story of the Creation, it has been thought well not
        only to give a fairly full translation of the Babylonian story of the
        Flood, but also to indicate under what circumstances <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page090">[pg 090]</span><a name="Pg090" id="Pg090"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that story appears in the series of
        tablets in which it is found.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first to
        detect the nature of the series of tablets giving the story of the
        Flood was the late George Smith, who had unrivalled opportunities of
        making himself thoroughly acquainted with the treasures of the
        British Museum in the matter of Assyrian records. As the story runs,
        it was whilst searching for the fragments of the Creation-series that
        he came across a fragment of a tablet mentioning that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the ship rested on the mountain of Niṣir,”</span> and
        this at once suggested to him that this was a reference to the Flood,
        as, in fact, it turned out to be. Continued and unremitting research
        among the treasures of the Department in which he was employed
        enabled him to bring together a large number of other fragments of
        the series, leaving, in fact, very little indeed for any future
        student to do in the way of collecting together texts from the
        fragments that he had an opportunity of examining. The <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Daily
        Telegraph</span></span> expedition to Assyria, which was conducted by
        Mr. Smith himself, enabled him to add many other fragments to those
        which he had already recognized in the Oriental Department of the
        British Museum, and Mr. Rassam's very successful excavations in the
        same place have since very considerably increased the list of
        additions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The story of the
        Flood, as known to the Babylonians and Assyrians, is one chapter or
        book of a legend consisting of twelve similar divisions, the first
        line of the series beginning with the words <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ša naqba
        imûru</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“He who saw
        everything,”</span> and to this is added in the colophons,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the legend of Gilgameš.”</span> The number
        of fragments extant is large, but the individual tablets are very
        imperfect, that giving the account of the Flood being by far the most
        complete, though even that has very regrettable lacunæ. Incomplete as
        the legend is as a whole, an attempt will nevertheless be made here
        to give some sort of a connected story, <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page091">[pg 091]</span><a name="Pg091" id="Pg091" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> which may be regarded as accurate in all its
        main details.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first tablet
        begins with the words that have been quoted above, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He who saw everything, [who] ... the land.”</span> This
        is followed, it would seem, by a description of the hero, who,
        apparently, knew <span class="tei tei-q">“the wisdom of the whole (of
        the lands?),”</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">“saw secret and
        hidden things.... He brought news of before the flood, went a distant
        road, and (suffered) dire fatigue (?).”</span> All his journeyings
        and toils were, apparently, inscribed on tablets of stone, and
        records thus left for future ages.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gilgameš, as we
        learn in the course of the narrative, was lord or king of
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Uruk
        supuri</span></span>, or <span class="tei tei-q">“Erech the
        walled,”</span> and at the time when the story begins, the
        fortifications were in a ruinous state, and the treasury (?) of the
        sanctuary Ê-anna, the temple of the goddess Ištar, which is mentioned
        in the legend immediately after, was, we may suppose, empty. Other
        details of the desolation of the temple are given, and the ruinous
        state of the walls of the city are spoken of, together with the decay
        of their foundations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No other fragment
        of Col. I. of the first tablet of the Legend of Gilgameš seems to
        have been recognized, so that the further references to the city are
        lost. An interesting piece that Mr. G. Smith thought to be part of
        the third column of this text refers to some misfortune that came
        upon the city when the people moaned like calves, and the maidens
        grieved like doves.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city was, on
        this occasion, besieged for three years, until at last the god Bêl
        and the goddess Ištar interested themselves in the state of things.
        As to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name=
        "Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> who the enemy was who
        brought the people into such distress, there is no means at present
        of finding out, but Mr. G. Smith suggested, with at least some show
        of probability, that they were the Elamites under Ḫumbaba, who
        appears later as the opponent of our hero. The indifference of the
        gods and the divine bulls that were supposed to protect the city is
        well expressed in the statement that they respectively turned into
        flies and mice, buzzing about and active, but doing no good
        whatever.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the
        reference to the state of Erech, the text is exceedingly mutilated,
        and the sense difficult to gather, but it would seem to have
        contained a further description of the hero, who, according to
        Jensen's translation, is described as <span class="tei tei-q">“two
        parts god and the third part man.”</span> To all appearance there was
        none in all his realm like him, and also no consort suitable for him,
        though he collected to him all the young men and maidens in the land.
        This was a matter for grief, which the (divine powers ?) heard, and
        they called upon the goddess Aruru to make another in his likeness.
        This being was Êa-banî,<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href=

        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> the
        mighty one, to all appearance made to be the rival of Gilgameš, but
        if this be the case, he did not fulfil his destiny, for his delight
        was to remain with the beasts of the field. All his body was covered
        with hair, and he had long tresses on his head, like those of a woman
        (recalling Samson's luxuriant locks). Far, too, from being the rival
        of Gilgameš, he became his most devoted friend and
        companion.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apparently he did
        not like being watched so long by the hunter, and becoming suspicious
        of his intentions, showed resentment, and tried to drive him away. It
        may be noted by the way, that this description of Êa-banî would
        answer excellently to the state attributed for a time to
        Nebuchadnezzar in the Book of Daniel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The hunter has a
        conversation with his father, who <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> was with him, and the upshot of it is that they
        decide to communicate to Gilgameš an account of the terrible man whom
        they had seen. It was therefore decided to try to catch or, rather,
        entice him to Erech by means of a female named Samḫat. In accordance
        with the instructions received, therefore, the hunter took with him
        the woman who was intrusted to him, and they awaited Êa-banî in the
        same place, by the side of the water. After watching for him for two
        days, they got into communication with him, and the woman asked him
        why he dwelt with the wild animals, depicting at the same time all
        the glory of Erech the walled and the nobility of Gilgameš, so that
        he soon allowed himself to be persuaded, and, in the end, went and
        took up his abode there.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Various things are
        then narrated, the most important of them being the episode of the
        Elamite Ḫumbaba, the same name, though not the same person, as the
        Kombabos of the Greeks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gilgameš seems to
        have gone to a place where there was a forest of cedar-trees,
        accompanied by Êa-banî. Near this place, apparently, there was a
        splendid palace, the abode (?) of a great queen. Judging from what
        remains of the text, they ask their way of her, and she it is who
        seems to tell them how to reach the dominions of the potentate whom
        they seek.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is with the
        sixth tablet that we meet, for the first time, almost, with something

        passage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apparently,
        Gilgameš had become, at the time to which this tablet refers, very
        prosperous, and that, combined with his other attractions, evidently
        drew upon him the attention of the goddess Ištar—</p><span class=

        have been far from satisfactory. Reference to a <span class=

        "tei tei-q">“the land of the enemy,”</span> seem to point to

        "tei tei-q">“Who is the bridegroom (whom thou hast kept?) for

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ištar being angry
        at these reproaches and accusations of the Babylonian hero,
        immediately ascended to heaven and complained to her father Anu and
        her mother Anatum that Gilgameš had reproached her with her
        enchantments and witcheries, and after a long conversation, a divine
        bull is sent against the hero and his friend. The heavenly animal is
        overcome, principally by the activity of Êa-banî, who after
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098"
        id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> its death, when the goddess
        Ištar was lamenting its overthrow, cut off a portion of the body, and
        threw it at her. Great were the rejoicings at Erech the walled at the
        triumph of the hero and his counsellor, and after the feast that was
        held, they all lay down to sleep. Êa-banî also lay down with the
        rest, and during the night he saw a dream, of the details of which
        nothing is known, though, from the words with which it seems to be
        introduced, <span class="tei tei-q">“My friend, on account of what do
        the gods take counsel,”</span> it may be supposed that the defiance
        and opposition which these mortals had offered to the goddess Ištar
        was engaging the attention of the heavenly powers with a view to some
        action being taken. As it is with these words that Êa-banî begins to
        tell his dream to Gilgameš, there is no doubt that the Babylonians
        regarded the former as having been admitted, whilst asleep (as in the
        case of the Babylonian Noah), into the councils of the gods. The
        solitary line that is quoted above is the first of the seventh
        tablet.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The details of the
        legend now again become obscure, but thus much can be gathered,
        namely, that Gilgameš in his turn had a dream, and that, all
        appearance, Êa-banî interpreted it. Later on, Êa-banî falls ill, and
        lies without moving for twelve days. Though unwilling to regard his
        friend as dead, Gilgameš mourns for him bitterly, and decides to make
        a journey, apparently with the object of finding out about his friend
        Êa-banî, and ascertaining whether there were any means of bringing
        him back to earth again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He sets out, and
        comes to the place where the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“scorpion-men,”</span> with their heads reaching to
        heaven, and their breasts on a level with Hades, guarded the place of
        the rising and the setting sun. The horror of their appearance, which
        was death to behold, is forcibly described on the tablet. The hero
        was struck with terror on seeing them, but as he was of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> divine origin (<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“his body is of the flesh of the gods,”</span> as the
        scorpion-man says to his female), death has no power over him on
        account of them. He seems to describe to them his journey, and the
        object he had in view. Pir-napištim, the Babylonian Noah, is
        mentioned in the course of the conversation, and it may be supposed
        that it is on account of his desire to visit him that he asks these
        monsters for advice. He afterwards comes into contact with the
        goddess Siduri, <span class="tei tei-q">“who sits upon the throne of
        the sea,”</span> and she, on seeing him, shuts her gate. He speaks to
        her of this, and threatens to break it open. Having gained admission,
        he apparently tells the goddess the reason of his journey, and she,
        in return, describes to him the way that he would have to take, the
        sea that he would have to cross, and of the deep waters of death that
        bar the way to the abode of the Babylonian Noah, who had attained
        unto everlasting life, and whose pilot or boatman, Ur-Šanabi, was to
        take the Erechite hero to his presence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a long
        conversation with Ur-Šanabi, concerning the road that they will take,
        they start together, and after passing through a forest, they embark
        in a ship, and reach, at the end of a month and ten days, the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“waters of death.”</span> There Gilgameš does
        something a number of times, and afterwards sees afar off
        Pir-napištim, the Babylonian Noah, who apparently communes with
        himself concerning the visitor who has come to his shores. The
        conversation which follows is very mutilated, but in the course of
        his explanation of the reason of his visit, Gilgameš relates all his
        adventures—how he had traversed all the countries, and crossed
        difficult mountains, his visit to Siduri, and her refusal to open the
        door to him, with many other things. The conversation apparently,
        after a time, becomes of a philosophical nature, for, in the course
        of it, Pir-napištim says—</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As this tablet
          is the most complete of the series, it may not be considered out of
          place to give here a description of the outward appearance of the
          document—or, rather, of the documents, for there are many copies.
          This description will serve, to a certain extent, for all the other
          tablets of the series, when in their complete state.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The size of the
          document which best shows the form is about 8-½ inches wide, by
          5-7/8 inches high. It is rectangular in form, and is inscribed on
          both sides with three columns of writing (six in all). The total
          number of lines, as given in the text published in the second
          edition of the fourth vol. of the <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cuneiform
          Inscriptions of Western Asia</span></span>, is 293, including the
          catch-line and colophon, but as many of these lines are, in
          reality, double ones (the scribes frequently squeezed two lines
          into the space of one, so as to economize space), the original
          number <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg
          101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of the lines was probably nearer 326, or, with the catch-line and
          colophon, 330. It is probable that the other tablets of the series
          were not so closely written as this, and in these cases the number
          of lines is fewer.</p>

          the second paragraph comes to an end, the total number of lost or
          greatly mutilated <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg

          lines being about nine. Very little of the contents of these lines
          can be made out, as not much more than traces of words remain.
          Where the lines begin to become fairly complete, the text seems to
          refer to the building of the ship, upon which four days had already
          been spent, its form being laid down on the fifth day. The
          description of the building, which is somewhat minute, is
          exceedingly difficult to translate, and any rendering of it must
          therefore, at the present time, be regarded as tentative. Its
          bulwarks seem to have risen four measures, and a deck (apparently)
          is mentioned. Its interior was pitched with six <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">šar</span></span> of bitumen, and its outside
          with three <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">šar</span></span> of pitch, or bitumen of a
          different kind. The provisionment of the vessel is next described,
          but this part is mutilated. A quantity of oil for the crew and
          pilot is referred to, and oxen were also slaughtered, apparently as
          a propitiatory sacrifice on the completion of the vessel. Various
          kinds of drink were then brought on board, both intoxicating and
          otherwise, plentiful (this may be regarded as the word to be
          supplied here) <span class="tei tei-q">“like the waters of a
          river.”</span> After this we have references to the completion of
          certain details—holes for the cables above and below, etc., and
          with this the third paragraph comes to an end.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Pir-napištim, in
          answer to this, tells Gilgameš what had been done to him, repeating
          the description of the preparation of his food in the same words as
          had been used to describe the ceremony (for such it apparently is),
          and ending by saying, <span class="tei tei-q">“Suddenly I touched
          thee, (even) I, and thou awokest, (even) thou.”</span> Thus putting
          beyond question the personality of the one who effected the
          transformation which was brought about, though he leaves out the
          word <span class="tei tei-q">“man,”</span> which hid from the hero
          the fact that a transformation had in consequence taken place in
          him. The ceremonies were not by any means finished, however, for
          the boatman or pilot had to take him to the place of lustration to
          be cleansed, and for the skin, with which he seems to have been
          covered, to fall off. The Babylonian patriarch then tells him of a
          wonderful plant which would make an old man young again, and
          Gilgameš gets possession of one of these. On his way to his own
          country in the company of the boatman or pilot, he stops to perform
          what seems to be a religious ceremony, at a well, when a serpent
          smells the plant,<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href=
          "#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a> and,
          apparently in consequence of that, a lion comes and takes it away.
          Gilgameš greatly laments his loss, saying that he had not benefited
          by the possession of this wonderful plant, but the lion of the
          desert had gained the advantage. After <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page110">[pg 110]</span><a name="Pg110" id="Pg110" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> a journey only varied by the religious
          festivals that they kept, they at length reached Erech, the walled.
          Here, after a reference to the dilapidation of the place, and a
          statement seemingly referring to the offerings to be made if
          repairs had not, during his absence, been effected, the eleventh
          and most important tablet of the Gilgameš series comes to an
          end.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of the twelfth
          tablet but a small portion exists, though fragments of more than
          one copy have been found. In this we learn that Gilgameš still
          lamented for his friend Êa-banî, whom he had lost so long before.
          Wishing to know of his present state and how he fared, he called to
          the spirit of his friend thus—</p>

          seems to invoke the goddess <span class="tei tei-q">“Mother of
          Nin-a-zu,”</span> seemingly asking her to restore his friend to
          him, but to all appearance without result. He then turned to the
          other deities—Bêl, Sin, and Ea, and the last-named seems to have
          interceded for Êa-banî with Nerigal, the god of the under-world,
          who, at last, opened the earth, <span class="tei tei-q">“and the
          spirit of Êa-banî like mist arose (?).”</span> His friend being
          thus restored to him, though probably only for a time, and not in
          bodily form, Gilgameš asks <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          down, let me weep,”</span> he answers. Seeing that he would not be
          denied, Êa-banî complies with his request. It was a place where
          dwelt people who had sinned in their heart, where (the young) were
          old, and the worm devoured, a place filled with dust. This was the
          place of those who had not found favour with their god, who had met
          with a shameful death (as had apparently Êa-banî himself). The

          graphic description of the world of the dead the twelfth and
          concluding tablet of the Gilgameš series comes to an end.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the
          Gilgameš series of tablets as a whole we have not here to concern
          ourselves, except to remark, that the story of the Flood is
          apparently inserted in it in order to bring greater glory to the
          hero, whom the writer desired to bring into connection with one who
          was regarded as the greatest and most renowned of old times, and
          who, on account of the favour that <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the gods had to him, had attained to
          immortality and to divinity. Except the great Merodach himself, no
          divine hero of past ages appealed to the Babylonian mind so
          strongly as Pir-napištim, who was called Atra-ḫasis, the hero of
          the Flood.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reason of
          the coming of the Flood seems to have been regarded by the
          Babylonians as two-fold. In the first place, as Pir-napištim is
          made to say (see p. <a href="#Pg100" class="tei tei-ref">100</a>),
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Always the river rises and brings a
          flood”</span>—in other words, it was a natural phenomenon. But in
          the course of the narrative which he relates to Gilgameš, the true
          reason is implied, though it does not seem to be stated in words.
          And this reason is the same as that of the Old Testament, namely,
          the wickedness of the world. If it should again become needful to
          punish mankind with annihilation on account of their wickedness,
          the instrument was to be the lion, or the hyæna, or pestilence—not
          a flood. And we have not to go far to seek the reason for this. By
          a flood, the whole of mankind might—in fact, certainly would—be
          destroyed, whilst by the other means named some, in all
          probability, would escape. There was at least one of the gods who
          did not feel inclined to witness the complete destruction of the
          human race without a protest, and an attempt on his part to
          frustrate such a merciless design.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Little doubt
          exists that there is some motive in this statement on the part of
          the Babylonian author of the legend. It has been already noted that
          Merodach (the god who generally bears the title of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Bêl</span></span>, or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“lord”</span>) was, in Babylonian mythology, not one of
          the older gods, he having displaced his father Ea or Ae, in
          consequence of the predominance of Babylon, whose patron god
          Merodach was. Could it be that the Babylonians believed that the
          visitation of the flood was due to the vengeful anger of Merodach,
          aroused by the people's non-acceptance <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of his kingship? It seems unlikely.
          Pir-napištim was himself a worshipper of Ae, and on account of that
          circumstance, he is represented in the story as being under the
          special protection of that god. To all appearance, therefore, the
          reason which Pir-napištim is represented as having given, for the
          building of the ship, to his fellow-townsmen, was not intended to
          be altogether false. The god Ellila hated him, and therefore he was
          going to dwell with Ae, his lord—on the bosom of the deep which he
          ruled. An announcement of the impending doom is represented as
          having been made to the people by the patriarch, and it is
          therefore doubly unfortunate that the next paragraph is so
          mutilated, for it doubtless gave, when complete, some account of
          the way in which they received the notice of the destruction that
          was about to be rained down upon them.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been more
          than once suggested, and Prof. Hommel has stated the matter as his
          opinion, that the name of the god Aê or Ea, another possible
          reading of which is Aa, may be in some way connected with, and
          perhaps originated the Assyro-Babylonian divine name Ya'u,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“God,”</span> which is cognate with the
          Hebrew Yah or, as it is generally written, Jah. If this be the
          case, it would seem to imply that a large section of the people
          remained faithful to his worship, and the flood of the Babylonians
          may symbolize some persecution of them by the worshippers of the
          god Ellila, angry at the slight put upon him by their neglect or
          unwillingness to acknowledge him as the chief of the Pantheon. Some
          of the people may, indeed, have worshipped Ae or Aa alone, thus
          constituting a kind of monotheism. This, nevertheless, is very
          uncertain, and at present unprovable. It is worthy of note,
          however, that at a later date there was a tendency to identify all
          the deities of the Babylonian <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page114">[pg 114]</span><a name="Pg114" id="Pg114" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> Pantheon with Merodach, and what in the
          <span class="tei tei-q">“middle ages”</span> of the Babylonians
          existed with regard to Merodach may very well have existed for the
          worship of Ae or Ea at an earlier date. The transfer, in the
          Semitic Babylonian Creation-story, of the name of Aê to his son
          Merodach may perhaps be a re-echo of the tendency to identify all
          the gods with Ae, when the latter was the supreme object of worship
          in the land. There is one thing that is certain, and that is, that
          the Chaldean Noah, Pir-napištim, was faithful in the worship of the
          older god, who therefore warned him, thus saving his life. Ae, the
          god who knew all things, knew also the design of his fellows to
          destroy mankind, and being <span class="tei tei-q">“all and always
          eye,”</span> to adopt a phrase used by John Bunyan, he bore, as a
          surname, that name Nin-igi-azaga, <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of
          the bright eye,”</span> so well befitting one who, even among his
          divine peers, was the lord of unsearchable wisdom.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
          unfortunately a difficult thing to make a comparison of the ark as
          described in Genesis with a ship of the Babylonian story. It was
          thought, by the earlier translators of the Babylonian story of the
          Flood, that its size was indicated in the second paragraph of the
          story (p. <a href="#Pg102" class="tei tei-ref">102</a>, ll. 11,
          12), but Dr. Haupt justly doubts that rendering. If the size of the
          vessel were indicated at all, it was probably in the next
          paragraph, where the building of the ship is described. This part,
          however, is so very mutilated, that very little clear sense can be
          made out of it. The Babylonian home-land of the story seems
          certainly to be indicated by the mention of two kinds of bitumen or
          pitch for caulking the vessel, Babylonia being the land of bitumen
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">par
          excellence</span></span>. Those who were to live on board were to
          sustain themselves with the flesh of oxen, and to all appearance
          they cheered the weary hours with the various kinds of drink of
          which they laid in store. They were not neglectful, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> either, of the oil that they used in
          preparing the various dishes, and with which they anointed their
          persons. All these points, though but little things in themselves,
          go to show that the story, in its Babylonian dress, was really
          written in the country of that luxury-loving people. The mention of
          holes for the cables, too, shows that the story is the production
          of maritime people, such as the Babylonians were.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apparently the
          Babylonians found there was something inconsistent in the patriarch
          being saved without any of his relatives (except his sons), and the
          artificers who had helped him to build the ship which was to save
          him from the destruction that overwhelmed his countrymen and
          theirs. For this reason, and also because of the relationship that
          might be supposed to exist between master and servant, his
          relatives and the sons of the artificers<a id="noteref_11" name=
          "noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a> are
          saved along with his own family, which, of course, would not only
          include his sons, but their wives also. On this point, therefore,
          the two accounts may be regarded as in agreement.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When all was
          ready, the Sun-god, called by the usual Semitic name of Šamaš,
          appointed the time for the coming of the catastrophe. This would
          seem to be another confirmation of the statement already made, that
          the Babylonians, like the Hebrews (see Gen. i. 14-18), regarded one
          of the uses of the sun as being to indicate seasons and times. It
          was a great and terrible time, such as caused terror to the
          beholder, and the patriarch was smitten with fear. Here, as in
          other parts of the Babylonian version, there is a human interest
          that is to a large extent wanting in the precise and detailed
          Hebrew account. Again the maritime <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> nation is in evidence, where the consigning
          of the ship into the care of a pilot is referred to. Of course such
          an official could do but little more than prevent disastrous
          misfortune from the vessel being the plaything of the waves. In the
          description of the storm, the terror of the gods, Ištar's grief,
          and Maḫ's anger at the destruction of mankind, we see the
          production of a nation steeped in idolatry, but there are but few
          Assyro-Babylonian documents in which this fact is not made
          evident.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have a return
          to the Biblical story in the sending forth of the birds, and the
          sacrifice of odoriferous herbs, when the gods smelled a sweet
          savour, and gathered like flies over the sacrificer. In the signets
          of Maḫ, <span class="tei tei-q">“the lady of the gods,”</span> by
          which she swears, we may, perhaps, see a reflection of the covenant
          by means of the rainbow, which the Babylonians possibly explained
          as being the necklace of the goddess. Instead of the promise that a
          similar visitation to destroy the whole of mankind should not occur
          again, there is simply a kind of exhortation on the part of the god
          Ae, addressed to Ellila, not to destroy the world by means of a
          flood again. To punish mankind for sins and misdeeds committed,
          other means were to be employed that did not involve the
          destruction of the whole human race.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Noah died at the
          age of 950 years (Gen. ix. 29), but his Babylonian representative
          was translated to the abode of the blessed <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“at the mouths of the rivers,”</span> with his wife, to
          all appearance immediately after the Flood. In this the Babylonian
          account differs, and the ultimate fate of the patriarch resembles
          that of the Biblical Enoch, he who <span class="tei tei-q">“was
          not, for God took him”</span> (Gen. v. 24).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is the
        Biblical account of the origin of the two most powerful states of the
        ancient East, Babylonia and Assyria. It has been many times quoted
        and discussed, but there seems always to be something new to say
        about it, or to add to it, or what has already been said may be put
        in another and clearer way. It is for one or more of these reasons,
        as well as for the completeness of this work, that the author
        ventures again to approach the well-worn problems that these verses
        present.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page119">[pg
        119]</span><a name="Pg119" id="Pg119" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Every reader, on
        taking up a book dealing with this period of ancient Eastern history,
        will probably have noticed, that the word which most frequently meets
        his eye (if the book be an English one) is Akkad, the Semitic
        equivalent of the Biblical Accad. If, however, it be a continental
        work, the equivalent expression will be Šumer—which word, indeed, he
        will meet with also in English works, if the writer be at all under
        German or other foreign influence.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reason for
        this divergence of opinion is very simple, the fact being that there
        were two tribes or nationalities, Šumer being before Akkad when the
        two countries are mentioned together, and as it is regarded as
        identical with the Shinar of Gen. x. 10, Šumer and Šumerian may
        possibly be preferable, but in all probability Akkad and Akkadian are
        not wrong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As we see from the
        chapter of Genesis referred to, there were many nationalities in the
        Euphrates valley in ancient times, and the expression <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Cush begat Nimrod,”</span> would imply that the
        inhabitants of Babylonia were all Cushites. Yet the great majority of
        the inscriptions found in that country of a later date than about
        2000 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> are Semitic.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Large additions
        have of late years been made to the number of ancient remains from
        Babylonia, and most of these are of a very early period. We are thus
        in a position to compare not only the different types of that early
        period with each other, but also with the sculptures of later date.
        The cylinder-seals show us a comparatively slim race, long-bearded,
        erect and dignified, and these characteristics are also recognizable
        among the various types revealed to us by the still earlier
        sculptures. The representations of kings and deities are often
        heavily bearded, but, on the other hand, high officials and others
        are generally clean shaven. These peculiarities, with the difference
        of costume, especially the thick-brimmed hats, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page120">[pg 120]</span><a name="Pg120" id="Pg120"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> would seem to imply distinct foreign
        influence, or, rather, in combination with the differences of racial
        type exhibited, considerable foreign admixture. Perhaps, however, the
        true explanation is, that the plain of Shinar represents the
        meeting-point of two different races—one Cushite and the other
        Semitic.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And this fact, as
        is well known, is confirmed by the existence of what is regarded as
        the language of the Akkadians, and also of a dialect of the same.
        This is not the place to discuss the question whether these
        non-Semitic idioms be really languages or only cryptographs—the
        author holds, in common with Sayce, Oppert, Hommel, and all the
        principal Assyriologists, that they are real languages—but a
        reference to the few passages where these idioms are spoken of may
        not be without interest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of these is
        the fragment known as S. 1190 in the British Museum, where the
        contents of the tablet of which it formed a part are referred to as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Two Šumerian incantations used”</span>
        (seemingly) <span class="tei tei-q">“for the stilling of a weeping
        child.”</span> Another tablet refers to the languages, and states
        that the tongue of Šumer was like (the tongue of) Akkad, or assumed a
        likeness to it at some time or other. This document also refers to
        another form of speech that was the tongue of the prince, chief, or
        leader. Yet another fragment refers to Akkad as below (? to the
        south) and Šumer above (? to the north),<a id="noteref_13" name=
        "noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> but it
        is doubtful whether this refers to the position of the country. A
        fourth large fragment written partly in the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“dialect”</span> is referred to as a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Šumerian”</span> text.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Both from the
        ethnographical and the linguistic side, therefore, ample testimony to
        the existence of a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page121">[pg
        121]</span><a name="Pg121" id="Pg121" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        non-Semitic race (or non-Semitic races) in the plain of Shinar in
        ancient times is at hand. As to the language intended in the
        expression <span class="tei tei-q">“Two Šumerian incantations”</span>
        (spoken of above) there can be no doubt, the original idiom in
        question being the non-Semitic tongue already referred to—that tongue
        which was like the tongue of Akkad, of which it was apparently a more
        decayed form. The title given cannot refer to the translation into
        Assyro-Babylonian which accompanies it, as this is undoubtedly of
        later date than the composition itself.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is then no
        doubt that the Akkadians and the Šumerians were two tribes of the
        same race, probably intermixed to a certain extent with foreign
        elements (people with oblique eyes being depicted on at least two of
        the sculptures of the early period from Tel-Loh), and speaking a
        language differing entirely from that of their Semitic
        fellow-countrymen,—a language which was of an agglutinative nature,
        introducing into its verbal forms whole rows of analytical particles,
        which sometimes gave to the phrase a precision of meaning to which
        the Semitic Babylonian has but little pretension, though
        Šumero-Akkadian is generally difficult enough in other respects, in
        consequence of the excessive number of the homophones that it
        contains. Indeed, it is sometimes difficult to see how the speakers
        of the latter language could have understood each other without
        resorting to some such distinctive aids similar to the tones used in
        modern—as probably also in ancient—Chinese, of which Šumero-Akkadian
        is regarded by the Rev. C. J. Ball as an exceedingly ancient
        form.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question of
        the origin of the Akkadians is one concerning which there has been
        and is still much uncertainty, and which presents many problems for
        the future. It has been remarked that the fact that there is no
        special ideograph for <span class="tei tei-q">“river,”</span> and the
        fact that <span class="tei tei-q">“mountain”</span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“country”</span> are represented by the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> same character, imply that the people
        with whom the cuneiform script originated came from a mountainous
        country—probably the tract to the east or the north-east. This
        assumption, however, is not wholly dependent on what is here stated,
        for it is a well-known and admitted fact that the ideograph generally
        used for <span class="tei tei-q">“Akkad”</span> stands also for other
        tracts that are largely mountainous, namely, Phœnicia and Ararat.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may be of
        interest here to quote the passage referring to this.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The text in
        question is the exceedingly important syllabary designated by Prof.
        Fried. Delitzsch <span class="tei tei-q">“Syllabary <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">B</span></span>.”</span> The text is
        unfortunately defective in the British Museum copy, but a duplicate
        found at Babylon by the German explorers completes it as
        follows:—</p>

        <table summary="This is a table" cellspacing="0" class=

            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this we see
        that the ideograph for Akkad not only stood for that country, but
        also for the land of the Amorites (Amurrū), and for Ararat (Urṭū),
        both of them being more or less mountainous districts. That the
        ancient home of the Akkadians was of the same nature is, therefore,
        more than probable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That the Akkadians
        were a conquering race is indicated by the legend of the god Ura,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Akkadians had
        dominion, at one time or another, over all the above nationalities,
        some of whom were permanently subjected. Tâmtu, the region of the
        Persian Gulf, was under their domination constantly, though the
        inhabitants were apparently rather turbulent, and unwilling subjects.
        The Assyrians were apparently for a time under Akkadian (Babylonian)
        rule, but threw it off at a very early period, and later on conquered
        Akkad itself. The Elamites, too, were for a while conquered by the
        inhabitants of Babylonia, and the Sutites (people of Sutî) are said
        to have been all transported by Kadašman-Muruš (he reigned about 1209
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, according to
        Hilprecht). It will thus be seen that they played an important part
        in the history of the plain of Shinar where they settled, and to all
        appearance introduced their civilization.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the earliest
        ages known to us, the land of Akkad was a collection of small states
        resembling the Heptarchy. These states differed considerably in
        power, influence, and prosperity, and the passing centuries brought
        many changes with them. From time to time one of the kings or
        viceroys of these small states would find himself more powerful than
        his contemporaries, and would gradually overcome all the others. One
        of the earliest instances of this is the ruler Lugal-zag-gi-si, whose
        reign is placed by Hilprecht <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page124">[pg 124]</span><a name="Pg124" id="Pg124" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> at about 4500 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> He was son of Ukuš (the
        reading is doubtful), viceroy (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">patesi</span></span>) of a district which seems
        to be that of which Kis was capital. <span class="tei tei-q">“He had
        conquered all Babylonia and established an empire extending from the
        Persian Gulf to the Mediterranean Sea”</span> (Hilprecht).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether he and his
        successors were able to maintain real dominion over all this
        extensive tract or not, we do not know, but a few hundred years later
        we find Sargon of Agadé (known as <span class="tei tei-q">“Šargani
        king of the city”</span>) subduing the land of the west in the 11th
        year of his reign, and placing the districts under one control,
        whilst his son, Naram-Sin, apparently added Elam to his dominions,
        and Uruwuš (whom Prof. Sayce suggests as the original of the Horus of
        Pliny), at a later date, led a warlike expedition thither, and
        brought away much spoil, some of which is still extant as a lasting
        testimony to the reality of this historical fact.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the states
        which existed in Akkad before the whole country was united under one
        king may be mentioned Isin or Karrak, Ur (the supposed Ur of the
        Chaldees), Kêš, Nippur (or Niffur), the modern Niffer, Lagaš, Êridu,
        Êrech, and Larsa (identified with Ellasar), with some others. Akkad
        and Babylon were always important centres, the former being supreme
        before the date of the dynasty of Babylon (about 2200 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>), and the latter
        afterwards.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Until about the
        time of the dynasty of Babylon, the language principally used was to
        all appearance the non-Semitic Babylonian or Akkadian—in any case,
        the numerous texts (mainly temple-accounts) of the period of Dungi,
        Bûr-Sin, Gimil-Sin, and Ibi-Sin are written in that tongue.
        Nevertheless, Akkadian seems to have been the official language of
        the country for a considerable time after, if we may judge from the
        contracts, and especially the historical dates of these documents,
        which are always written in Akkadian. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page125">[pg 125]</span><a name="Pg125" id="Pg125" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> The names, too, which were before this period
        wholly Akkadian, gradually become more and more Semitic
        (Assyro-Babylonian), and finally the Akkadian element only exists as
        a remnant of the non-Semitic tongue which prevailed before the
        Semitic Dynasty of Babylon—that to which Ḫammurabi or Amraphel
        belonged—made the Semitic tongue, spoken by Sargon of Agadé more than
        1500 years before, the official language of the country.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such, then, is the
        history of the ancient Akkadians, from whose intermingled stock the
        later Semitic Babylonians sprang, and who inherited, at the same
        time, their method of writing, their literature, their arts and
        sciences, and also, to a great extent, their manners, customs, and
        religion. It was to all appearance with the Semitic dynasty of
        Ḫammurabi that the change from non-Semitic to Semitic predominance
        took place. This change must have been slow enough, and in all
        probability it occurred without any national upheaval, and without
        any interruption of the national life. Semitic names gradually
        replaced the Akkadian ones, most of the religious works,
        incantations, national histories, bilingual lists, and syllabaries
        were supplied with Semitic translations, and legal precedents in
        Semitic Babylonian for the information of the judges of later times
        were drawn up, whilst the old Akkadian laws, though retained, were
        translated for the use of students who no longer learned Akkadian as
        their mother-tongue, and who committed them to memory at the same
        time as they learned the set phrases they would have to use when,
        their education completed, they should attain to the dignity of
        full-fledged ministers to the legal needs of the community. By this
        time, or somewhat later, the racial type must have become fixed, for
        the sculptures from the thirteenth century <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> downwards no longer
        show the slim, elegant form of the Akkadians, but the thick-set,
        well-developed figure of the Semites, such as at <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page126">[pg 126]</span><a name="Pg126" id="Pg126"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> least some of the native Christians of
        Baghdad and the neighbourhood show at the present day.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As has been
        already noticed, the Assyrians spoke the same language, and had
        practically the same religion and literature (including the ancient
        Akkadian classics) as the Babylonians, whom they resembled in
        manners, customs, and outward appearance. The old translation of the
        verse referring to Assyria, <span class="tei tei-q">“Out of that land
        (Babylonia) went forth Assur,”</span> is, in all probability,
        perfectly correct, whatever may be the arguments in favour of the
        rendering, <span class="tei tei-q">“He (Nimrod) went out into
        Assyria,”</span> for it is exceedingly likely that the Babylonian
        civilization of Assyria is wholly due to emigration of settlers from
        Babylonia. Moreover, as will be seen later on, the enigmatical Nimrod
        is none other than the well-known head of the Babylonian Pantheon,
        Merodach, who is actually stated to have built Babel (= the city
        Babylon), Erech, and Niffer (identified in Rabbinical tradition,
        which in this case is probably correct, with Calneh). The Babylonian
        tradition as to the foundation of the city of Akkad is still wanting,
        but that its origin was attributed to Merodach is more than probable.
        If, however, there had been any grounds for honouring Calah, Nineveh,
        and Resen with the same divine origin, the Assyrians would certainly
        not have allowed the tradition to go unrecorded. Properly speaking
        the <span class="tei tei-q">“land of Nimrod”</span> (Micah v. 6) is
        Babylon, notwithstanding all arguments to the contrary, for that was
        the land which he loved, the land whose great cities he was regarded
        as having founded and as still favouring, and the land where, if we
        may trust the language of his name (in Akkadian it means <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the brightness of day”</span>), he ruled when he was
        king upon earth—the land, in fact, which gave him birth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At first governed
        by <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">patesis</span></span>, or viceroys (many
        Assyriologists call them priest-kings or pontiffs), this title was
        abandoned for that of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">šarru</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“king,”</span> between <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> 1600 and 1800 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> The use of the title
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">patesi</span></span> (in Assyrian <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">iššaku</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“chief”</span>) implies that the earlier rulers of Assur
        acknowledged some overlord, and in all probability this overlord was
        the paramount king of Babylonia at the time. If we regard Nimrod
        (Merodach) as the first king of Babylonia (or the first really great
        ruler of the country), then it is certain that it was not he who
        founded the great cities of Assyria, for they can have no pretensions
        to the same antiquity as the great cities of Babylonia, any more than
        Assyrian civilization can be of the same period. Of course it is
        probable that the cities of Assyria were founded at an exceedingly
        early date, perhaps many of them are as old as any Babylonian
        foundation, but their importance was nothing like so great as those
        of Babylonia until the latter had already been renowned many
        hundreds—perhaps many thousands—of years, and to attribute the origin
        of these unimportant places to Nimrod would bring him no honour, even
        if it were probable that he had founded them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The founder of
        Nineveh, Calah, Rehoboth Ir, and Resen was either a Babylonian
        emigrant named Asshur, the first viceroy of the district, or else
        Asshur, in the tenth chapter of Genesis, stands for the Assyrian
        nation. It is noteworthy that, in the verse in question, there is no
        mention of the foundation of the old capital, the city of Aššur. This
        is probably to be explained by the fact that the book of Genesis was
        compiled at a time when the primæval capital had already fallen into
        the background, and Nineveh, the city first mentioned in the
        enumeration, had assumed the first place—indeed, the fact that it is
        mentioned first seems to prove this contention.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Being far away
        from the centre of civilization, and apparently mingling with
        barbarous races to the north—the people of Urarṭu (Ararat), Van,
        Ukka, Muṣaṣir, etc.—in all probability the ancient Assyrians lost
        what polish they had brought with them from Babylonia, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and, like all pioneers, developed into
        hardy, fearless, and cruel warriors, constantly striving for the
        mastery over all the other tribes and nationalities around. Thus it
        came to pass that, having ascertained her strength, Assyria refused
        to acknowledge the overlordship of the kings of Babylonia, and the
        rulers of the country abandoned the title of <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">patesi</span></span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">iššaku</span></span> for that of <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">šarru</span></span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“king.”</span> The country from which the Assyrians had
        sprung did not long remain secure from the attacks of her offspring,
        and the conquest of Babylonia by the Assyrians took place more than
        once. Brave, warlike, and cruel, the Assyrians at last possessed for
        a time not only Babylonia, with the overlordship of Elam, but also
        the whole of Western Asia as far as the Mediterranean and Cyprus, and
        a large part of Egypt. Notwithstanding the polish that they had
        attained during the last years of the empire, the nations around
        remembered against them all the cruelties that they had committed
        during the foregoing centuries, and when the time of weakness came,
        when the ruling mind that should have held the empire together, and
        turned the tide of disaster into the channel of success, was wanting,
        then came the chance of the nations that had known the Assyrian
        empire in former ages, and the end of the seventh century before
        Christ saw the last of the power that had dominated Western Asia so
        long and so successfully.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet Assyria was a
        most remarkable power, and produced a number of really great rulers
        and generals. The Assyrian kings retained for a long time their
        dominion over fairly distant tracts, and made themselves greatly
        feared by all the nations around. As is well known, they had made
        great advances in the art of sculpture, so much so that visitors to
        the British Museum, on seeing the wonderful hunting-scenes in the
        Assyrian side-gallery, have been heard to express the opinion that
        Greek artists must either have originated them, or influenced their
        production. Their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page129">[pg
        129]</span><a name="Pg129" id="Pg129" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        literature was naturally influenced by that of Babylonia, but one has
        only to read the historical records of Tiglath-pileser I., who
        declaims his successes in forceful and elegant paragraphs;
        Sennacherib, with his wealth of words; or Assur-banî-âpli, who in
        moderate and elegant phrases tells of the successes of his soldiers
        and generals, to see that, when occasion arose, they could produce
        literary works as good as the best of ancient times.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will probably
        be a matter of regret to many people, but the name of Nimrod, which
        we have been accustomed to associate with the pleasures and perils of
        the chase for so many hundred years, must now be relegated to the
        domain of words misunderstood or purposely changed for reasons that
        can without much difficulty be divined.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not Nimrod
        alone that comes under this category—Nibhaz (2 Kings xvii. 31),
        judging from the Greek, is in the same case, Nisroch (2 Kings xix.
        37) is certainly so, and Abed-nego for Abed-nebo is a well-known
        instance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But why, it will
        be asked, should these names have been intentionally changed? The
        answer is simple. All these names were, or contained, the names of
        heathen deities, and this offended the strongly monotheistic Hebrew
        scribe who, at a certain period, was copying the portions of the
        Hebrew Bible in which they occur, so he defaced them, adding or
        changing a letter, and thus making them unrecognizable, and in all
        probability ridiculous as well. A different punctuation (vowelling)
        completed the work, and the names were then in such a form that pious
        and orthodox lips could pronounce them without fear of
        defilement.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nibhaz is probably
        for some such name as Aba-hazar, Nisroch is for Assur or Assuraku,
        and Nimrod is, by similar changes, for Amaruduk or Amarudu (original
        Akkadian), Maruduk or Marduk (Assyro-Babylonian). The change was
        brought about by making the root triliteral, and the ending
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">uk</span></span> (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ak</span></span>
        in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name=
        "Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Merodach-baladan)
        disappearing first, Marduk appeared as Marad. This was connected with
        the root Marad, <span class="tei tei-q">“to be rebellious,”</span>
        and the word was still further mutilated, or, rather, deformed by
        having a (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ni</span></span>) attached, assimilating it to a
        certain extent to the <span class="tei tei-q">“niphal forms”</span>
        of the Hebrew verbs, and making a change altogether in conformity
        with the genius of the Hebrew language. This alteration is also
        clearly visible in Nibhaz and Nisroch, which fully confirm the
        explanation here given.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From a linguistic
        point of view, therefore, the identification of Nimrod as a changed
        form of Merodach is fully justified.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But there is
        another and a potent reason for eliminating Nimrod from the list of
        Babylonian heroes, and that is, the fact that his name is nowhere
        found in the extensive literature which has come down to us. His
        identification with Gišdubar was destroyed when it was discovered
        that the true reading of that doubtful name was not, as it was
        expected that it would be, a Babylonian form of Nimrod, but something
        entirely different, namely, Gilgameš. Moreover, there is some doubt
        whether the personage represented on the cylinder-seals struggling
        with lions and bulls be really Gilgameš (Gišdubar)—his prowess in
        hunting does not seem to be emphasized in the legend recounting his
        exploits (see pp. <a href="#Pg092" class="tei tei-ref">92-111</a>)—he
        is in all probability the wild man of the woods who became his great
        friend and counsellor, the satyr-like figure who is represented as
        accompanying and imitating the hunter being simply one of those
        beings who, the Babylonians imagined, existed in wild and waste
        places, for that this creature is not, as was at first supposed,
        Êa-banî, the friend of Gilgameš, is not only proved by the fact that
        in the legend he is described as a man with hairy body and hair long
        like that of a woman, but also by the incontestable circumstance that
        this satyr-like creature is, on certain cylinders, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> represented more than once, and in such a
        way that the repetition cannot be attributed to the exigencies of the
        design. Moreover, he is sometimes represented in positions that seem
        to have no connection with the Gilgameš-legend at all.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would seem
        therefore to be certain that Gilgameš is not Nimrod; that as he had
        little or no fame as a <span class="tei tei-q">“great hunter before
        the Lord,”</span> it cannot be he who is represented on the
        cylinder-seals; and that, in all probability, the hunter there
        represented is Êa-banî, who overcame the divine bull before Erech,
        and a lion after the defeat of Ḫumbaba, in both cases, however,
        assisted by his royal patron.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, it may be
        asked, how is it that Nimrod, otherwise Merodach, is described as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the mighty hunter before the
        Lord”</span>?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The explanation is
        very simple, and remarkably conclusive in its way. Merodach, in the
        legend of the Creation, there appears as the greatest hunter (using
        the word in the Hebrew sense of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“entrapper”</span>) that ever lived. For did he not, when
        Tiamtu, the great dragon of chaos and disorder, tried to usurp the
        dominion of the gods, and bring ruin on their fair work, chase and
        entrap her, thereby winning the throne of the kingdom of heaven, and
        laying the universe under an everlasting debt to him? With his net he
        caught and held her fast, and, standing on her body, slew her. This
        was the feat of a real <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">gibbor ṣayid</span></span>, a <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“hero in hunting,”</span> or entrapping with a net, for
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ṣayid</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“hunting,”</span> is from the same root as Sidon, the
        name of the ancient <span class="tei tei-q">“fishing town,”</span>
        renowned of old, and still existing at the present
        day.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name=

          <span style="font-size: 144%">The Tower Of Babel.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no
          doubt that one of the most striking and attractive episodes of the
          sacred narrative of Genesis is the Tower of Babel. It has attracted
          the attention of all from its circumstantial details, and has, as
          an authoritative narrative, had the full belief of all the faithful
          for many thousand years. This being the case, it is needful to go
          rather carefully into the matter, not only to try to account for
          its origin, but also to satisfy the believer of to-day with regard
          to the story being a real historical fact.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in
          their lands,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“These are the sons of
          Ham, after their families,”</span>—<span class="tei tei-q">“These
          are the sons of Shem, after their families,”</span> says the author
          of Genesis in ch. x. 5, 20, and 31, and then he adds, in slightly
          varying words, <span class="tei tei-q">“after their tongues, in
          their lands, in their nations.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet, after this
          (ch. xi. 1) we have the statement, <span class="tei tei-q">“And the
          whole earth was of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">one</span></em> language, and of <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>
          speech.”</span> Moreover, how was it possible that the whole of the
          nations of the earth there enumerated in the tenth chapter should
          have had their origin at Babel, the beginning of Nimrod's
          (Merodach's) kingdom, coeval with Erech, Akkad, and Calneh, in the
          land of Shinar? The effect of such a statement as this would surely
          be to make the language of Nimrod the primitive language of the
          world, unless, indeed, all the languages of the earth resulting
          from the confusion of tongues were regarded as new, the primitive
          speech of man having been destroyed on that occasion. Then, again,
          as we know, the building of the city was not stopped, for it
          continued until it became the greatest and most important centre in
          the known world when it was at the height of its glory.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the best
          will in the world, therefore, there <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> seems to be no escape from regarding both the
          story of the Tower of Babel, and the reference to Nimrod and Asshur
          in the foregoing chapter as interpolations, giving statements from
          ancient and possibly fairly well-known records, recording what was
          commonly believed in the ancient East in those early ages. It is
          also noteworthy, that both extracts, referring as they do, to
          Babylonia, are probably on that account from a Babylonian source.
          May it not be possible, that they have been inserted in the sacred
          narrative as statements of what was the common opinion among the
          more well-informed inhabitants of Western Asia at the time, without
          any claim to an inspired authority being either stated or implied?
          This would seem to be the most reasonable way of looking at the
          matter, and would take away what might well be regarded as a great
          difficulty to the believer in good faith.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If this be
          conceded, we can with the greater ease analyze this portion of the
          eleventh chapter of Genesis, and estimate it at its true value.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In any case,
          there is great improbability that the statement that the whole
          earth was of one language and of one speech, was ever believed, by
          thinking men at the time as an actual historical fact. A better
          translation would be <span class="tei tei-q">“the whole
          land,”</span> that is, the whole tract of country from the
          mountains of Elam to the Mediterranean Sea, rather than
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the whole earth.”</span> The same word is
          used when the <span class="tei tei-q">“land”</span> of Israel is
          spoken of, and also when <span class="tei tei-q">“the land of
          Egypt”</span> is referred to. It will thus be seen that no violence
          whatever is done to the text if the restricted use of the word be
          accepted.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That this is, in
          a sense, provable as an historical fact, we shall see in the
          sequel.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having thus in a
          measure cleared the way, the various points of the first nine
          verses of the eleventh chapter of Genesis may be taken in
          order.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“As they journeyed in the east”</span> apparently
          refers <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page134">[pg
          134]</span><a name="Pg134" id="Pg134" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          to the remembrance of the migrations that many a nation, handing
          down its traditions from mouth to mouth, must have preserved in
          ancient times. Whilst thus engaged, <span class="tei tei-q">“they
          found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt there”</span>—a
          statement which would seem to point to the migrants having been
          wandering about in various districts, some of them mountainous—like
          Armenia on the north of Assyria, and Elam and other mountainous
          tracts on the east. This would seem to agree with the migration
          which, from the evidence of the monuments of Babylonia, the
          Akkadians apparently made before they settled in that country. And
          here it may be noted, in support of that fact, that the
          ideograph<a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href=
          "#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a> for
          Akkad, Uri or Ura in Akkadian, and Akkadū in Semitic Babylonian,
          not only stood for Akkad, but also (often used in the Assyrian
          letters) for Ararat (Urṭū), and likewise (this in a syllabary only)
          for Amurrū, the land of the Amorites, or Phœnicia. Both these being
          districts more or less mountainous, it is only reasonable to
          suppose that the original home of the Akkadians was likewise of the
          same nature, and that they were not aborigines of the Babylonian
          plain. The Akkadians at least, therefore, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“journeyed in the east.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          expression <span class="tei tei-q">“they found a plain in the land
          of Shinar,”</span> we have a reference to the old name of a
          district of Babylonia, generally regarded as the Šumer of the
          Babylonian inscriptions, called Kingi or Kengi <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the country”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">par
          excellence</span></span> in the native tongue of the inhabitants.
          The land of Shinar here spoken of, if this explanation be correct,
          not merely contained a plain—it was, in fact, itself a large plain,
          through which the rivers Tigris and Euphrates ran, and it was
          covered, when the land had been brought into a really good state of
          cultivation, by a network of canals connected with them. It must,
          when the ancient Akkadians first settled there, have been a land of
          remarkable <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page135">[pg
          135]</span><a name="Pg135" id="Pg135" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          fertility, and would be so still were it brought into the same
          efficient state of cultivation, with irrigation and drainage, such
          as the old inhabitants effected.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, having
          settled down, they built a city and a tower, using brick for stone,
          and bitumen for mortar—just as they are proved to have done from
          the remains of cities found in the country at the present day. That
          Babylon was the site of the first settlement of the nature of a
          city is conceivable, and it is very possible that the first tower
          in Babylonia, which in later times had many towers, as had also
          Assyria, was situated in that ancient city. Everything points,
          therefore, to the correctness of the statements made in this
          portion of the sacred narrative. According to native tradition,
          however (and this seems to be supported by the statements in ch. x.
          10), there were other important cities on the Babylonian plain of
          almost equal antiquity, namely, Erech, Akkad, and Calneh, which
          last is identified with Niffer (see p. <a href="#Pg126" class=
          "tei tei-ref">126</a>). Notwithstanding the extensive ruins, proof
          of the same remote date for Babylon will doubtless be difficult to
          obtain, on account of the country around and a large portion of the
          site of the city being so marshy. The result of this condition of
          things will in all probability be, that very few remains of a
          really ancient date will be discovered in a condition to render
          services to archæology. To this must also be added the fact, that
          the city, being the capital for some thousands of years, underwent
          many changes at the hands of its various kings, partly from the
          necessity of keeping in good repair the many comparatively
          perishable brick monuments that the city contained, and partly from
          a desire to add more to the glories of the city than any of their
          predecessors had done.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“And they said, Come, let us build us a city, and a
          tower, and its top (lit. head) shall be in the heavens.”</span> To
          all appearance, this means simply that they would <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page136">[pg 136]</span><a name="Pg136" id="Pg136"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> build a very high structure,—to many a
          student of the sacred text it has seemed that the writer only
          intended to say, that the tower (<span lang="he" class=
          "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">migdol</span></span>) that they were about to
          build was to be very high. The mountains of Elam were not so very
          far off, and travellers from that part would have been able to
          assure them that the heavens would not be appreciably nearer on
          account of their being a few hundred cubits above the surface of
          the earth, even if traditions of their fathers' wanderings had not
          assured them of the same thing. They wished simply to make them a
          name and a rallying-point, <span class="tei tei-q">“lest,”</span>
          as the sacred text has it, <span class="tei tei-q">“we be scattered
          abroad upon the face of the whole earth.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And here a few
          remarks upon the temple-towers of the Babylonians might not be out
          of place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As has already
          been stated, most of the principal towns of Babylonia each
          possessed one. That of Babylon (called Šu-ana in the list published
          in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western
          Asia</span></span>, vol. ii., pl. 50) was named Ê-temen-ana,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the temple of the foundation-stone of
          Heaven”</span>; that of Borsippa, near to Babylon, was called
          Ê-ur-imina-ana, generally translated <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          temple of the seven spheres of heaven,”</span> on account of its
          being dedicated to the sun, moon, and planets. This was a high and
          massive tower in seven stages, each coloured with an emblematic
          tint indicating the heavenly body with which each stage was
          associated. At Niffer the tower seems to have had three names, or
          else there were three towers (which is unlikely), the principal one
          being Im-ur-sag. Agade, the Akkad of Gen. x. 10, had two of these
          temple-towers, Ê-Dadia, apparently meaning <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the temple of the (divine) Presence,”</span> and
          Ê-šu-gala or Ê-igi-ê-di, the latter apparently meaning <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the temple of the wonder (of mankind),”</span> which
          was dedicated to the god Tammuz. At Cuthah there was the temple of
          Nannara (Nan-naros); at Ur the temple Ê-šu-gan-du-du; at Erech
          Ê-gipara-imina, <span class="tei tei-q">“the temple of the seven
          enclosures”</span>; <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg
          137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          at Larsa Ê-dur-an-ki, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Temple of the
          bond of heaven and earth.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The only
          temple-tower that contains in its name a distinct reference to the
          seven stages of which it was composed, is that at Borsippa, though
          that at Erech may possibly have in its name <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“seven enclosures”</span> a suggestion of something of
          the kind. As, however, the ruins of the towers at Dûr-Sargina
          (Khorsabad) in Assyria, Erech, Niffer, and elsewhere, show
          distinctly this form of architecture, there is every probability
          that they were all, or almost all, built on the same plan. In his
          description of the glories of Babylon, Herodotus gives details, in
          his usual minute way, of the temple of Belos (Ê-sagila) there. He
          describes it as having eight stages (the platform upon which the
          tower proper was built being counted as one), and judging from his
          description, this building must have differed somewhat from the
          others, the various platforms being connected by a gradually rising
          ascent, arranged spirally as it were, so that by constantly walking
          upwards, and turning at the corners of the edifice, one at last
          reached the top. About the middle of this long ascending pathway
          there was a stopping-place, with seats to rest upon. Having reached
          the top of the structure, the visitor came upon a cell, within
          which there was a couch and a golden table. Here it was supposed
          that the god descended from time to time to dwell. Below, he
          relates, there was another cell, wherein was a large statue of Zeus
          (Belos) sitting. This image was of gold, as were also the table in
          front of it, the god's footstool, and his seat. It is probable that
          at the time to which the narrative in Genesis refers, the tower was
          neither so high, nor the workmanship so splendid and valuable, as
          in later times.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But was this the
          Tower of Babel? We do not know. The general opinion is that the
          great and celebrated temple-tower at Borsippa, extensive remains
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page138">[pg 138]</span><a name=
          "Pg138" id="Pg138" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of which still
          exist, was that world-renowned erection. Its name, however, was
          Ê-zida, and it was not situated within Babylon. Notwithstanding the
          fact, therefore, that Borsippa, the town on the outskirts of the
          great city, was called <span class="tei tei-q">“the second
          Babylon,”</span> and that tradition associates the site of the
          Tower of Babel with that spot, it must still be held to be very
          doubtful whether that was really the place. Neither the renown of
          Ê-zida nor that of Ê-sagila prove that either of them must have
          been the place, for the populace is fickle-minded in this as in
          other matters, and holy fanes have the periods when they are in
          fashion, just like anything else.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This being the
          case, the question is, what was that Ê-temen-ana-kia which is
          apparently mentioned in the list of temple-towers quoted above? In
          many an inscription of Nebuchadnezzar, this temple-tower is
          referred to, though very shortly, as having been restored by him.
          Thus, in the great cylinder of Nebuchadnezzar, 85-4-30,
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
          plan of Babylon drawn up by Weissbach, one of the German explorers,
          Ê-temen-ana-kia was situated to the north of Ê-sagila, which latter
          was evidently the temple connected with it. As both were dedicated
          to Merodach (Bel), they practically formed one centre of worship,
          and it is possibly on this account that the Tower is called
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the Temple of Belus”</span> in Herodotus.
          The description, from a Babylonian tablet probably in private
          hands, published by the late George Smith, agrees well with that
          given by Herodotus, but has some noteworthy differences—the great
          height of the lowest stage, the sloping (?) sides of the second
          stage, and the buildings grouped near it. Unfortunately, the baked
          brickwork of Ê-temen-ana-kia has been cleared away, practically
          destroying the remains.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Concerning the
          miracle of the confusion of tongues, there is, of course, no
          historical reference. The Babylonian inscriptions know nothing of
          it. Yet the stranger visiting Babylon could not have been otherwise
          than struck by the number of languages spoken there. There was the
          religious tongue, which is called by modern scholars Akkadian or
          Šumerian, and its dialect, together with the language known as
          Assyrian, or, more correctly, Semitic Babylonian. <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Besides this, there were various
          Aramaic dialects—Chaldee, Aramean (Syriac), and the language of the
          dockets on the trade-documents, which is also found in Assyria. In
          addition to these, the Elamite and Kassite conquerors of Babylonia
          brought with them large numbers of people, and each of these
          nations naturally introduced, in larger measure than before, the
          use of their respective languages. Speakers of other tongues long
          since dead must also have visited the city for the purposes of
          trade, and of this the so-called Hittite is in all probability an
          example (in the researches of Profs. Sayce and Jensen we shall,
          perhaps, see the beginnings of the recovery of this tongue), and a
          docket in an unknown script implies that yet another language heard
          there in later times has to be discovered, though this may simply
          be some other way of writing one of the tongues spoken there that
          is already known to scholars. With regard to the oneness of the
          language of the rest of the earth, in all probability this
          expression referred, as has been already remarked, to the tract
          enclosed between the mountains of Persia on the east, the
          Mediterranean on the west, Asia Minor and Armenia on the north, and
          Arabia on the south—a tract in which the <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lingua
          franca</span></span> of diplomacy was, as is proved by the
          Tel-el-Amarna tablets, the tongue now called Assyrian, which could
          easily have been regarded as the proofs and the remains of the
          thing that had been.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To recapitulate:
          The story of the Tower of Babel is a break in the narrative of the
          genealogies, so striking that any thinking man must have been able
          to recognize it easily. It is a narrative that practically
          glorifies Babylonia, making it the centre of the human race, and
          the spot from which they all migrated after the dispersion caused
          by the confusion of tongues. It was probably given for, and
          recognized as, the legend current in Babylonia at the time, and
          must, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name=
          "Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> therefore, have been
          recognized and valued by the people of the time at its true
          worth.</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">The Patriarchs To
          Abraham.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Little
          information is unfortunately to be obtained from Assyro-Babylonian
          sources concerning the patriarchs from Shem to Abraham. It is true
          that certain comparisons can be made in the matter of the names,
          but these, when more precise information comes to light, may be
          found to be more or less erroneous. As a matter of fact, with one
          or two exceptions, it is probable that we have nothing from
          Babylonian sources bearing on the patriarchs who preceded Abraham
          at all.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
          there are one or two things that may be put forward in a more or
          less tentative way, and these may well be discussed with this
          reservation in this place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As we have seen,
          it was the custom of the early Babylonians to deify the early
          rulers of their race, and as a well-known example of this, the case
          of the god Merodach will at once occur to the mind. As has been
          shown, this deity is none other than the long-known and enigmatical
          hero Nimrod, and it is probable that, if we had more and more
          complete sources of information, other instances would be found.
          This being the case, it may be permitted to the student to try to
          find similar instances of deification by the Babylonians of the men
          of old who were their ancestors in common with the Jews and other
          nations of the ancient East.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To begin with
          Shem, the name of the ancestor of the Semitic race. As a word, this
          means, in Hebrew, <span class="tei tei-q">“name.”</span> Now, the
          Assyro-Babylonian equivalent and cognate word is <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">šumu</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“name,”</span> and this naturally leads one to ask
          whether Shem may not have been designated <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He of the Name”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">par
          excellence</span></span>, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page142">[pg 142]</span><a name="Pg142" id="Pg142" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> deified under that appellation. If this be
          the case, we may perhaps see the word Shem in certain names of
          kings and others of the second dynasty of Babylon (that to which
          Ḫammurabi or Amraphel belonged, and which held the power from about
          2230 to 1967 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>). Sumu-abi, the name
          of the first ruler of the dynasty, would then mean <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Shem is my father,”</span> Sumu-la-ili would mean
          <span class="tei tei-q">“a name to his god,”</span> with a punning
          allusion to the deified ancestor of the Semitic nations.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Other names, not
          royal, are Sumu-Upê, apparently, <span class="tei tei-q">“Shem of
          Opis”</span>; Sumu-Dagan, <span class="tei tei-q">“Shem is
          Dagon,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Name of Dagon”</span>;
          Sumu-ḫatnu, <span class="tei tei-q">“Shem is a protection”</span>;
          Sumu-atar, <span class="tei tei-q">“Shem is great,”</span> and the
          form Samu-la-ili for Sumu-la-ili leads one to ask whether Samia may
          not be for Sumia, <span class="tei tei-q">“my Shem,”</span> a pet
          name abbreviated from a longer one similar to those already quoted;
          Sumu-ya (= Sumia) also occurs. All these forms, being written with
          s, instead of š, like Samsu-iluna for Šamšu-iluna, betray foreign
          (so-called Arabic) influence, and are not native Babylonian. That
          the Babylonians had at this time names compounded with the native
          representative of Sumu is shown by the contracts of that time,
          where the name Šumum-libši, <span class="tei tei-q">“let there be a
          name,”</span> occurs. Many later instances of this are to be
          found.<a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href=
          "#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From other than
          Bible sources there is but little that can be gathered concerning
          the descendants of Shem, though in this, as in many other things,
          one lives in hopes of something coming to light later on. And such
          a record, as may readily be imagined, would be of the greatest
          interest and value. Shem, as one of those born before the Flood,
          must certainly on that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg
          143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          account have been renowned (as we have just seen he was, if it be
          true that he was deified) among other nations of Semitic stock than
          the Hebrews. To all appearance, the lives of the patriarchs
          decreased greatly after the Flood, and are represented, in the
          Bible narrative, as gradually assuming the average duration of
          those who attain a hoary old age at the present day. It is
          noteworthy that his eldest son was born two years after the Flood,
          and if this have any ethnic meaning, it ought to point to the
          foundation of the settlement known as Arpachshad at about that
          period, though it could not have attained to the renown of a
          well-known and recognized community until some time after that
          date.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The theory that
          Arpachshad represents a community is rather supported by the fact
          that it is mentioned in Gen. x. 22, where it is accompanied by the
          names of Elam, Asshur, Lud, and Aram, which were later, as we know,
          names of nationalities. Indeed, the long lives of the patriarchs of
          this exceedingly early period are best explained if we suppose that
          they represent a people or community.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is a
          considerable amount of difference of opinion as to the correct
          identification of the Arpachshad of Gen. ix. 10, though nearly
          every critic places the country it represents in the same tract. It
          has been identified with Arrapkha, or Arrapachitis, in Assyria.
          Schrader makes it to be for Arpa-cheshed, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the coast of the Chaldeans.”</span> Prof. Hommel, who
          is always ready with a seductive and probable etymology, suggests
          that Arpachshad is an Egyptianized way of writing Ur of the
          Chaldees—Ar-pa-Cheshed, for Ur-pa-Cheshed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This, it must be
          admitted, is a possible etymology, for Egyptianized words were
          really used in that district in ancient times. This is shown in the
          name of Merodach, Asari, which is apparently connected with the
          Egyptian Osiris, just as one of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page144">[pg 144]</span><a name="Pg144" id="Pg144" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> names of the Sun-god Šamaš, Amna, is probably
          an Akkadianized form of the Egyptian Ammon, and even the Egyptian
          word for <span class="tei tei-q">“year,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ronpet</span></span>, made, probably by early
          Babylonian scribes, into a kind of pun, became, by the change of a
          vowel, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ran pet</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“name of heaven,”</span> transcribed, by those same
          scribes, into <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">mu-anna</span></span>, which, in its ordinary
          signification, means likewise <span class="tei tei-q">“name of
          heaven,”</span> in Akkadian; the whole being used with the meaning
          of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ronpet</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“year.”</span> It will thus be seen that
          there is but little that is unlikely in Prof. Hommel's etymology of
          Arpachshad, and that the explanation which he gives may turn out to
          be correct.<a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href=
          "#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In any case, we
          may take it that the consensus of opinion favours the supposition
          that the name in question refers to Babylonia, and if this be the
          case, Abraham, the father of the Hebrew nation, as well as of other
          peoples, was really, as has been supposed, of Babylonian or
          Chaldean origin. This is also implied by the statement in Gen. xi.
          28, that Ur of the Chaldees was the land of the nativity of Haran,
          Abraham's brother, who died in the country of his birth before the
          family of Terah went to settle at Haran, on the way to Canaan. The
          theory of the identity of Arpachshad is moreover important, because
          it is contended that Ur of the Chaldees was not in Babylonia, but
          is to be identified with the site known as Urfa, in
          Mesopotamia.</p>

          names of Shelah, Eber, Peleg, Reu, Serug, and Nahor, there is not
          much that can be said. To all appearance they are not Babylonian

          Nothing is recorded concerning these patriarchs except their ages
          at the time their eldest sons were born, and at what age they died.
          The question whether the Hebrews derived their name from their
          ancestor Eber is not set at rest by any passage in the Bible, nor
          is there any statement in secular literature which would enable
          this to be decided. To all appearance, it is needful to keep the
          name of Eber distinct from that of the Hebrews, notwithstanding
          that they are from the same root. If, however, the Hebrews were
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the men from beyond,”</span> then Eber may
          well have been <span class="tei tei-q">“the man from
          beyond,”</span> indicating for his time a migration similar to that
          of Abraham. In this way, if in no other, the names may be
          connected.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We have seen
          that in many cases the names of these <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“genealogical tables”</span> are regarded as
          nationalities, and, indeed, there is sufficient justification for
          such a theory on account of many of the names appearing as those of
          well-known nations. This being conceded, it would probably not be
          too much to regard the names of the patriarchs from Shelah to Serug
          as indicating ethnical historical events. Thus Shelah might mean
          <span class="tei tei-q">“extension,”</span> indicating the time
          when the Semitic race began to go beyond its ancient borders.
          Treating the other names in the same way, Eber would mean the
          period when that race crossed some river into another district;
          Peleg would mean that, at the time referred to, that race, or a
          portion of it, was divided into small states, as Babylonia was at
          the period preceding that of the dynasty of Amraphel; whilst Reu
          would mean <span class="tei tei-q">“friendliness,”</span> denoting
          the time when those states were united under one head, and the old
          dissensions ceased. Serug would then mean something like
          <span class="tei tei-q">“interweaving,”</span> perhaps referring to
          the time when the various races (? of Babylonia) intermingled.
          These explanations of the names receive a certain amount of
          confirmation from <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg
          146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the parallel list in Gen. x. 25, where to the name Peleg the note
          is added, <span class="tei tei-q">“for in his days was the earth
          divided.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to
          Nahor and his son Terah the Jews had other traditions, and they
          speak thus concerning them—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Terah, son of Nahor, was the chief officer of king
          Nimrod, and a great favourite with his royal master. And when his
          wife Amtheta, the daughter of Kar-Nebo, bare him a son, she called
          his name Abram, meaning <span class="tei tei-q">‘great
          father.’</span> And Terah was seventy years old when his son Abram
          was born.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here we have, in
          Amtheta, a doubtful Babylonian name, in Kar-Nebo a possible
          Babylonian name, and in the meaning of Abram a signification that
          does not militate against the indications given by the tablets of
          Babylonia and Assyria. This being the case, it would seem that
          there were trustworthy data to go upon for certain facts connected
          with Abraham's ancestors, and that these facts were known to the
          Jews of earlier ages. The Talmudic account of the wonders seen at
          the birth of Abram, however, are not sufficiently worthy of
          credence to allow of repetition here, notwithstanding their
          reference to Terah and Abraham's youth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Eusebius quotes
          the following from Eupolemus concerning Abraham—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“He saith, moreover, that in the tenth generation in a
          city of Babylonia, called Camarina (which, by some, is called the
          city of Urie, and which signifyeth a city of the Chaldeans), there
          lived, the thirteenth in descent, (a man named) Abraham, a man of a
          noble race, and superior to all others in wisdom.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Of him they relate that he was the inventor of
          astrology and the Chaldean magic, and that on account of his
          eminent piety he was esteemed by God. It is further said that under
          the directions of God he removed and lived in Phœnicia, and there
          taught the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg

          Phœnicians the motions of the sun and moon, and all other things;
          for which reason he was held in great reverence by their
          king”</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Praep. Evan.</span></span> 9).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nicolas of
          Damascus, apparently wishing to glorify his own city, states that
          Abram was king of Damascus, and went there, with an army, from that
          part of the country which is situated above Babylon of the
          Chaldeans, afterwards transferring his dwelling to the land which
          was at that time called Canaan, but is now called Judea. Justin
          also states that Abraham lived at Damascus, from which city he
          traces the origin of the Jews.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
          most trustworthy traditions, therefore, as well as from the Bible
          itself, Abraham was of Chaldean or Babylonian origin. If the city
          of Urie or Ur be, as he says, that which was also called Camarina,
          this would in all probability be the Aramean form of the Arabic
          <span lang="ar" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ar"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">qamar</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the moon,”</span> and the name Camarina would be due
          to the fact that the Moon-god, Sin or Nannara, was worshipped
          there. It is also noteworthy that the city whither the family of
          Terah emigrated, Haran (in Assyro-Babylonian, Ḫarran), was likewise
          a centre of lunar worship, and some have sought to see in that a
          reason for choosing that settlement. In connection with this it may
          be remarked, that in the Talmud Terah, the father of Abraham, is
          represented as an idolater, reproved by his son Abraham for foolish
          and wicked superstition.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We see,
          therefore, from the eleventh chapter of Genesis, that Abraham was a
          Babylonian from Ur, now known as Mugheir (Muqayyar), or (better
          still) from that part of the country which lay north of Babylon,
          known by the non-Semitic inhabitants as Uri, and by the Semitic
          population as Akkad. As the family of Terah was a pastoral one,
          they must have pastured their flocks in this district until they
          heard of those more fruitful tracts in the west, and decided to
          emigrate thither. And here it may be noted that <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> they did not, by thus quitting their
          fatherland, go to swear allegiance to another ruler, for the sway
          of the king of Babylon extended to the farthest limits of the
          patriarch's wanderings, and wherever he went, Babylonian and
          Aramean or Chaldean would enable him to make himself understood. He
          was, therefore, always as it were in his own land, under the
          governors of the same king who ruled in the place of his birth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The name of the
          patriarch, moreover, seems to betray the place of his origin. The
          first name that he bore was Abram, which has already been compared
          with the Abu-ramu, <span class="tei tei-q">“honoured
          father,”</span> of the Assyrian eponym-lists (in this place an
          official by whose name the year 677, the 5th year of Esarhaddon,
          was distinguished). At an earlier date than this the name has not
          been found, and the element <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ram</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ramu</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">rame</span></span>, etc., seems to be rare.
          Ranke's list gives only <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Sumu-ramê</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the name is established,”</span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sumu (? Shem) is established,”</span> or something
          similar, but <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ramê</span></span> here is probably not
          connected with the second syllable of Abram's name. The name of
          Sarah has been compared with the Assyro-Babylonian <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">šarratu</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“queen,”</span> but seems not to occur in the
          inscriptions. Isaak is also absent, but Ishmael, under the form of
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Išme-îlu</span></span> (meaning <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“(the) god has heard”</span>) occurs, as well as others
          in which <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">îlu</span></span> is replaced by Êa, Sin, and
          Addu or Adad (Hadad).</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When, however,
          it was revealed to Abram that he was to stay in the Promised Land,
          a change was made in his name—he was no longer known by the
          Assyro-Babylonian name Abram, <span class="tei tei-q">“honoured
          father,”</span> but, in view of the destiny appointed for him, he
          was to be called Abraham, <span class="tei tei-q">“father of a
          multitude of nations.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first
          stratum of the Hebrew nation was, therefore to all appearance,
          Babylonian, the second stratum Aramean, probably a kindred stock,
          whilst the third was to all appearance Canaanitish. All these must
          have left their trace on the Hebrew character, and, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page149">[pg 149]</span><a name="Pg149" id="Pg149"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> like most mixed races, they showed at
          all times superior intelligence in many ways. They were good
          diplomates, brave warriors, divine lawgivers, and they excelled in
          literary skill. One great defect they had—among their many
          defects—they were stiffnecked to a fatal degree. Had their kings
          been less obstinate and better rulers, conciliating their subjects
          instead of exasperating them, the nation might have outlasted the
          power of Rome, and built upon its ruins in their land a kingdom
          dominating the Semitic world in the nearer East to the present
          day.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of all the
          characters of early Bible history, there is hardly one which stands
          out with greater prominence than the patriarch Abraham. And not
          only is it his history and personality that is important—the
          historical facts touched upon in the course of his biography are
          equally so. Facts concerning the ancient East, from Babylonia on
          the east to Egypt on the west, face the reader as he goes through
          that attractive narrative, and make him wonder at the state of
          society, the political situation, and the beliefs of the people
          which should have made his migrations possible, brought about the
          monotheistic belief which characterizes his life and that of his
          descendants, and enabled him and his sons after him to attain such
          a goodly store of the riches of this world.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To begin with
          Babylonia, his native place. As is well known, that country had
          already been in existence as a collection of communities far
          advanced in arts, sciences, and literature, at an exceedingly early
          date, and many of the small kingdoms of which it consisted had
          become united under Ḫammurabi (Amraphel) into one single state,
          making it one of the greatest powers at the time. Of course, it is
          not by any means improbable that something similar to this had
          existed before, but if so, we have no record of the fact, though it
          is certain that different states had from time to time become
          predominant and powerful to an extent hardly <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page150">[pg 150]</span><a name="Pg150" id="Pg150"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> conceivable. The influence, if not the
          sway, of Sargon of Agadé, who reigned about 3800 years before
          Christ, for example, extended from Elam on the east to the
          Mediterranean on the west—a vast tract of territory to acknowledge
          the suzerainty of so small a state.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Babylonia,
          therefore, with a long history behind it, was beginning to feel, to
          all appearance, a new national life. It had passed the days when
          the larger states boasted strength begotten of mere size, and when
          the smaller states sought mutual protection against the larger,
          finding in that alone, or in the acknowledgment of an overlord, the
          security upon which their existence as separate states depended.
          There is every probability that it was at this time that the
          legends which formed the basis of Babylonian national literature
          were collected and copied, thus assuring their preservation. It is
          also probable that the translations from Akkadian of the numerous
          inscriptions written in that language, and the bilingual lists,
          syllabaries, and other texts of a similar nature, belong to this
          period.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The social
          condition of Babylonia itself at this time is now fairly well
          known. The ancient Akkadian laws were still in force, but as they
          did not provide for all the possibilities that might arise, a large
          series of legal enactments was compiled, in which points were
          decided in a very common-sense and just manner. It is noteworthy
          that the number of tablets of a legal nature is very numerous, and
          arouses the suspicion that the Babylonians were exceedingly fond of
          litigation, due, no doubt, to the tendency they had to overreach
          each other. It is therefore very probable that this is the reason
          why we meet with that remarkable contract of the purchase of the
          field of Machpelah from the children of Heth. One would have
          imagined that the frequent protestations, made by the head of the
          tribe there located, to the effect that he gave the field and the
          cave to Abraham, would have been sufficient, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page151">[pg 151]</span><a name="Pg151" id="Pg151"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> especially at that solemn moment of the
          burial of Sarah, and that the matter could have been put upon a
          legal footing later on. But no, the patriarch was determined to
          have the matter placed beyond dispute there and then, and knowing
          how prone the Babylonians (with whom he had passed his youth) were
          to deny a contract, and try to get back again, by perjury, what
          they had already parted with for value, the matter was at once
          placed beyond the possibility of being disputed in any court of
          law.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href=

        kings, which fresh excavations alone can fill up. Before this gap the
        records, as far as we know them, are in the Akkadian language. After
        this gap they are in the Semitic-Babylonian tongue. To all
        appearance, troublous times had come upon Babylonia. The native
        rulers had been swept away by the Elamites, who, in their turn, had
        been driven out by the Semitic kings of Babylonia, but those Semitic
        kings were not Babylonians by origin, notwithstanding that the native
        scribes, who drew up the lists of kings, describe them as being a
        Babylonian dynasty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The change may
        have been gradual, but it was great. Many of the small states which
        had existed at the time of Dungi, Bûr-Sin, Gimil-Sin, Ibi-Sin, and
        their predecessors had to all appearance passed away, and become part
        of the Babylonian Empire long before the dynasty of Babylon came to
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153"
        id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> an end, though some at least
        were in existence in the time of the great conqueror Ḫammurabi. But
        the change was, as it would seem, not one of overlordship
        only—another change which had been gradually taking place was, by
        this, carried one step farther, namely, the Semiticizing of the
        country. Before the period of the dynasty of Babylon, the two races
        of Akkadians and Semitic Babylonians had been living side by side,
        the former (except in the kingdom of which Sippar was the capital)
        having the predominance, the records being written in the Akkadian
        language, and the kings bearing mainly Akkadian names, though there
        were, for the Semitic inhabitants, translations of those names.
        Translations of the inscriptions and legends, as well as the old
        Akkadian laws, probably did not (except in the Semitic kingdom of
        Agadé) exist.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How it came about
        is not known, but it is certain that, about 2200 years <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, a purely Semitic
        dynasty occupied the throne of the chief ruler in Babylonia. The
        first king was Sumu-abi, who reigned 14 years. This monarch was
        followed by Sumu-la-ili and Zabû, 36 and 14 years respectively. Then
        come two rulers with Babylonian names—Abil-Sin and Sin-mubaliṭ, 18
        years and 20 years. These are followed, in their turn, by Ḫammurabi
        (43), Samsu-iluna (38), Ebišum (25), Ammi-ṭitana (25), Ammi-zaduga
        (21), and Samsu-ṭitana (31 years). This dynasty, therefore, lasted
        about 285<a id="noteref_18" name="noteref_18" href=
        "#note_18"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">18</span></span></a> years,
        and with two exceptions, Abil-Sin and Sin-mubaliṭ, the names, though
        Semitic, are not Babylonian.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet it was called
        by Babylonians <span class="tei tei-q">“the dynasty of
        Babylon!”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And this, in all
        probability, is correct. The dynasty must, on account of the name
        given to it, have come from that city, but was, at the same time, of
        foreign origin, its kings being descended from another dynasty which
        came from some other part of the Semitic world of that time. This is
        indicated by the following facts.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Three of the
        tablets of which we shall learn something more farther on, and which
        are preserved in the British Museum, have invocations of a personage,
        apparently a king, named Anmanila. The name of this ruler naturally
        recalls the Anman of the dynasty following that of Babylon—namely,
        the dynasty of Uru-ku; but the style of the writing of these three
        documents is not that of the later period, but of the beginning of
        the dynasty of Babylon, and there is, on that account, every
        probability that Anmanila was one of the predecessors of Sumu-abi,
        the first king of the dynasty of Babylon. It is, of course, possible
        that this ruler was simply a co-regent with one of the kings already
        known, like Immerum, who lived at the time of Sumu-la-îla, or
        Buntaḫun-îla,<a id="noteref_19" name="noteref_19" href=
        "#note_19"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">19</span></span></a> another
        associate with Sumu-la-îla on the throne, but there is a certain
        amount of improbability in this, as Anmanila is named alone, and not
        in connection with any other. Moreover, it is probable that, in the
        case of the two co-regents here mentioned, we have examples of sons
        associated with their father, and one replacing the other on account
        of the early death of his brother. Another ruler, probably of the
        period preceding that of the dynasty of Babylon, is Manamaltel, whose
        name <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name=
        "Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is found on a tablet
        belonging to the Rev. Dr. J. P. Way, head-master of Rossall School,
        and it is noteworthy that one of the tablets bearing the name of
        Anmanila gives, among the witnesses, a certain Sumuentel,<a id=
        "noteref_20" name="noteref_20" href="#note_20"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">20</span></span></a> a name
        having the same termination as Manamaltel, a component which seems to
        have been common at this early period, and rare or non-existent
        later. Most, if not all, the above are foreign names.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next question
        that arises is, what was the nationality of these rulers, who, though
        belonging to what was called <span class="tei tei-q">“the dynasty of
        Babylon,”</span> were not really of Babylonian origin?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The key to the
        matter is probably furnished by the following inscription of
        Ammi-ṭitana, the ninth king of the dynasty—</p>

        </table>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this
        inscription, Ammi-ṭitana calls himself not only <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“king of Babylon,”</span> and other important places in
        Babylonia, but <span class="tei tei-q">“king of Amoria”</span> (if
        the coining of a word for the district be allowed) also. Now, as we
        know from the Tel-el-Amarna tablets, Amurrū is <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the name that the Babylonians used for
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the west,”</span> which Assyriologists
        formerly read (on account of the polyphony of the Babylonian system
        of writing) Aḫarrū. In reality, however, this word, Amurrū, stands
        for the land of the Amorites, and the probability is, that the land
        of the Amorites belonged to the Babylonian Empire because it formed
        part of the original domain of the rulers of Babylonia at this time,
        who, if not of Amorite descent, may at least have had Amorite
        connections.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In any case, there
        is but little doubt that the population of Babylonia was very mixed
        2000 years before Christ. As we know from the tablets, Amorites were,
        during this period, numerous in Babylonia, and the god whose name is
        written with the characters MARTU (a common group for Amurrū)—the
        fact is revealed by one of the tablets of late date published by
        Reisner—are to be read Amurrū, and the best translation is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Amorite god,”</span> whose name and
        worship seem to have been introduced into the Babylonian Pantheon at
        a much earlier date, and was known to the Akkadians under the name of
        Martu. It is noteworthy that, in the text in question (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Mitteilungen aus den
        orientalischen Sammlungen</span></span>, Heft. x. pl. 139, 147-81),
        the Akkadian Martu and Babylonian Amurrū is called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“lord of the mountain,”</span> probably because the
        country of the Amorites, especially when compared with Babylonia, is
        mountainous.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In addition to the
        god Amurrū, other deities of western origin appear in the
        inscriptions (generally in the names) from time to time. Thus we have
        Abdu-Ištara, interesting as giving an early form of the name Astarte
        (Ashtoreth), before it received the feminine termination; Ụsur-Malik,
        probably <span class="tei tei-q">“protect, O Malik”</span> (Moloch),
        Nabu-Malik, probably <span class="tei tei-q">“Nebo is Malik”</span>
        (Moloch), or <span class="tei tei-q">“Nebo is king”</span>; Ibi-Šân,
        probably <span class="tei tei-q">“speak, O Shân,”</span> which
        reminds the reader of Beth-Shean, the modern Beisan; and there are
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157"
        id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> also, in all probability,
        other Amorite deities whom we cannot identify, on account of their
        names not occurring in other ancient literatures than the Babylonian.
        Ibaru, found in the name Arad-Ibari, <span class="tei tei-q">“servant
        of Ibari,”</span> Abâ, in the name Arad (Abdi)-Abâ, Alla, in the name
        Ur-Alla, <span class="tei tei-q">“man of Alla”</span> (though this is
        possibly a Babylonian [Akkadian] name), etc., are probably
        non-Babylonian, but not Amorite.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the names
        of west Semitic deities, however, the names of west Semites
        themselves occur, and show that there was a considerable immigration
        in those ancient days into the country. Thus the word Amurrū,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Amorite,”</span> is exceedingly common,
        and one is not surprised to learn that, in consequence of the
        Amorites being so numerous, there was an Amorite district in the
        neighbourhood of Sippar. Other names of men which are apparently from
        the country spoken of are, Sar-îli, probably <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“prince of God,”</span> and the same as Israel; Karanatum
        (probably for Qaranatum), which would seem to mean <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“she of the horned deity”</span> (compare Uttatum,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“he of the sun,”</span> Sinnatum,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“he of the moon”</span>), and reminds us of
        Ashteroth Karnaim, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ashteroth of the two
        horns,”</span> the well-known site in Palestine. Besides these, we
        meet more than once with such names as Ya'kub, Jacob, with its longer
        form, Ya'kub-îlu, Jacob-el; and in like manner the name of Joseph and
        its longer form Joseph-el occur—Yasup and Yasup-îlu. Êsâ, the father
        of a man named Siteyatum, reminds us of Esau; Abdi-îli, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“servant of God,”</span> is the same as Abdeel; and
        Ya'zar-îlu, <span class="tei tei-q">“God has helped”</span> (compare
        Azrael), Yantin-îlu, <span class="tei tei-q">“God has given”</span>
        (compare Nethanel), with many others similar, receive illustration.
        In all probability, too, many of the bearers of names compounded with
        Addu (Hadad), Amurrū, and other names of deities naturalized in
        Babylonia, as well as some of the bearers of true Babylonian names,
        were, in reality, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg
        158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        pure west Semites. Further examples will be found in the texts
        translated farther on, and the more noteworthy will be pointed out
        when they occur.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will thus be
        seen that the population of Babylonia 2000 years before Christ had a
        considerable admixture of west Semites, many of whom would come under
        the designation of Amorites; besides other nationalities, such as
        Armenians or people of Aram-Naharaim (Mesopotamia)—at least two
        tablets refer exclusively to transactions between members of this
        northern race—Sutites, and Gutites, who were low-class people
        seemingly light-haired, <span class="tei tei-q">“fair Gutian
        slaves”</span> being in one place spoken of.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Life in Babylonia
        at this early period must have been exceedingly primitive, and
        differed considerably, as the East does even now, from what we in
        Europe are accustomed to. The city of which we can get the best idea,
        Sippar, the Sippara of the Greeks, generally regarded (though
        probably wrongly) as the Sepharvaim of the Bible, now represented by
        the mounds known as Abu-habbah, whence most of the early
        contract-tablets revealing to us the daily life of these ancient
        Babylonians came, was situated on the Euphrates, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the life of the land.”</span> The name of this river is
        written, when phonetically rendered, by the characters Purattu
        (probably really pronounced Phuraththu), in Akkadian Pura-nunu,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the great water-channel,”</span> often
        expressed (and then, of course, not phonetically) with characters
        meaning <span class="tei tei-q">“the river of Sippar,”</span> showing
        in what estimation the ancient Babylonians held both river and city.
        The mound of Abu-habbah is four miles from the river Euphrates, and
        situated, in reality, on the canal called Nahr-Malka, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the royal river,”</span> which runs through it; but the
        tablets of the period of which we are now speaking refer not only to
        the city itself, but to the district all round from the Tigris on the
        east to the Euphrates on the west.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The digging of
        canals, which was an exceedingly important work in those days, as
        indeed it is now, was evidently very systematically done, and the
        king often, to all appearance, made a bid for increased popularity by
        digging an important new canal for irrigation purposes, to which his
        name was attached. Thus we find the work of Sumu-la-ilu, Sin-mubaliṭ,
        Ḫammurabi, Samsu-iluna, and other kings recorded and chosen as the
        event of the year to date by. This, with the rebuilding or new
        decoration of the temples and shrines, endeared the king to the
        people and the priesthood, ensuring for him the faithful service of
        both, and willing submission to his rule. Indeed, there is but little
        doubt that the presence of foreign rulers in the country was often
        due to their having made friends of the priestly classes, and
        afterwards of the people, in this way.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As may be judged
          from the specimens of Babylonian names already given, the
          inhabitants of this part of the world were exceedingly religious.
          In <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name=
          "Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> every city of the
          land there were great temples, each of which made its claim on the
          people who formed the congregation—in other words, the whole
          population. In the district of which we are at present treating—the
          tract where the majority of early contract-tablets were found,
          namely, Sippar—the chief objects of worship were the Sun-god Šamaš;
          his consort, the Moon-goddess, Aa; Bunene, a deity of whom but
          little is known; Anunitum, a goddess identified with Ištar or
          Venus; Addu or Rammanu (Hadad or Rimmon), and, in later times at
          least, among others, <span class="tei tei-q">“the divine Daughters
          of Ê-babbarra.<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href=
          "#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a>”</span>
          All these deities were worshipped in the temple of the place,
          called Ê-babbarra, <span class="tei tei-q">“the (divinely)
          brilliant house,”</span> the earthly abode of the god Šamaš and his
          companions. In addition to this great and celebrated temple, of
          such renown in later times that even Egyptians, sun-devotees in
          their own country, attended the services and made gifts, temples
          were erected to the other gods of Babylon, notably Sin, the
          Moon-god; to Merodach, the chief deity of Babylon; and likewise in
          all probability to Merodach's consort, Zer-panitum, who was
          worshipped along with him. There was probably hardly a town in
          ancient Babylonia and Assyria where one or more of these gods were
          not honoured—indeed, the sun had also another centre of worship,
          namely, Larsa, the Ellasar of Gen. xiv. 1, as well as less renowned
          shrines. Ištar was venerated at Erech along with Anu; Sin, the
          moon, under the name of Nannar, had a great and celebrated temple
          at Ur (generally regarded as Ur of the Chaldees), and also at
          Haran, the city of Abraham's sojourning; Nebo was worshipped at
          Borsippa; Nergal at Cuthah; Gula, goddess of healing, at Babylon;
          Ê-girsu (<span class="tei tei-q">“the lord of Girsu”</span>) at the
          city of Girsu, apparently a part of Lagaš; Êa and Tammuz at Eridu,
          etc.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg
          161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the province
          of which Sippar was capital, however, the people were more than
          usually religious, or else more records of their piety have come
          down to us. Numerous persons, more especially women, are described
          as devotees, or perhaps priestesses, of the Sun-god there, and
          sometimes similar devotees of Merodach are mentioned. Though we
          have no certain information, it is very probable that there were
          all over the country people dedicated to the various deities,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the gods of the land,”</span> for what was
          customary in the district of Sippar (Sippar-Amnanu and
          Sippar-Ya'ruru) was in all probability equally so in the other
          provinces of the empire. From the earliest times the temples
          acquired and held large tracts of land, which the priests let to
          various people, agriculturists and others, to cultivate, a certain
          proportion of the produce being paid to them, added to the revenues
          of the temples, and passed into the treasury of the god. To this
          lucrative business of land-letting was added that of money-lending,
          and interest in the weaving-industry of the place, both of which
          increased enormously in later times. That the temples received from
          time to time rich gifts from the king, goes without saying, for the
          colophon-dates record many instances of this. Sumu-abu, for
          instance, rebuilt or restored the temples of the Lady of Isin, and
          the temple Ê-maḫ of Nannar (the Moon-god); Sumu-la-îla made a
          throne of gold and silver for the great shrine of Merodach;
          Abil-Sin seems to have given a similar object to the temple of the
          Sun at Babylon; Ḫammurabi restored or gave thrones to the temples
          of Zer-panitum, Ištar of Babylon, Nannar (the moon), and built a
          great shrine for Bel. Samsu-iluna, likewise, was not negligent of
          the gods, for it is related of him that he dedicated a bright
          shining mace (?) of gold and silver, the glory of the temple, to
          Merodach, and made Ê-sagila (the great temple of Belus at Babylon)
          to shine like the stars of heaven. It is needless to <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> say, that the long lists of the pious
          works of the rulers of Babylon would be much too long to enumerate
          here.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this the
          kings did from motives of policy, to conciliate the priests, and,
          through them, the people. Sometimes, though, they had need of the
          priests, who were able to render them service, and then, naturally,
          they bought their good-will cheerfully. The service which the
          priests rendered in return was to pray to the gods for the king's
          health and his success against his enemies, or in any undertaking
          in which he might be engaged, and to inquire of the gods for him
          whether he would be successful. Many, too, were the ceremonies and
          festivals in which king, priests, and people took part, and the
          king (who was himself a priest) and the priesthood thrived
          exceedingly.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes, too,
          it happened that a devotee or servant of another god than that
          which was the divinity of the place, struck with the neglect of the
          deities whom he worshipped, would decide to remedy that defect, and
          to this end he would found a small temple himself, and endow it.
          The following will show in what way this took place—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The light of his god,”</span> Nûr-îli-šu apparently
          wished to justify his name, and to show what a faithful servant he
          was, and he therefore dedicated the temple to the deity mentioned.
          This, according to the inscriptions, should be Merodach, one of
          whose titles was <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">šarru</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the king.”</span> It is to be noted, however, that in
          the district of Sippar the Sun-god was <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“king,”</span> and if this be the case, the pious giver
          of the temple, instead of wishing to honour the patron god of
          another district, merely intended to honour the patron god of his
          own in another aspect, namely, as king in the heavens, along with
          his consort, here called Šullat, a name which, to all appearance,
          simply means <span class="tei tei-q">“the bride.”</span> That the
          Sun-god was intended seems to be indicated by the name of the
          priest, Pî-ša-Šamaš, <span class="tei tei-q">“Word of the
          Sun-god,”</span> though it was not by any means impossible for a
          man bearing the name of another god as part of his own to officiate
          in this capacity, especially in the case of Merodach, for the
          latter was, in many respects, a sun-god, and therefore identified
          with Šamaš. In any case, the new temple was under the protection of
          the Sun-god, as the statement (<span class="tei tei-q">“he is an
          enemy of Šamaš and Šuma-ilu”</span>) shows. It is noteworthy that,
          in the names of the witnesses, Šamaš does not occur as a component
          part in any case.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But a small
          foundation like this must have had but little influence beside the
          great temple of the Sun-god at Sippara, with its revenues from
          lands, dues on grain, tithes, free-will offerings, and gifts on
          special occasions. In addition to all that has been mentioned
          above, the temple of the Sun-god was the great court of justice,
          and the people resorted thither to settle their disputes, and in
          all probability gifts were made to the Sun-god on those occasions.
          The gates of the city, too, were favourite places for this,
          especially that of Šamaš, and there is every probability that gifts
          to the god had to be made there also. The power and <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> influence of the places of worship on
          account of all these temporal and sacerdotal duties invested in
          them can be easily imagined.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Around the
          Babylonian king is hedged a certain amount of mystery, for we see
          him but dimly. What he did year by year we know, but what his
          general way of life was the tablets do not reveal to us. He lived
          in a <span class="tei tei-q">“great house,”</span> <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ê-gala</span></span> in Akkadian, <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">êkallu</span></span> in Semitic Babylonian,
          and there is hardly any doubt that the people looked upon him as a
          great high-priest, and often as being himself divine. Indeed, some,
          if not many, of the Babylonian kings were regarded as gods, and had
          their worshippers, apparently whilst they were still inhabitants of
          this earth. The deification of the early Babylonian kings is made
          known to us by the scribes placing the usual divine prefix before
          their names, and with certain rulers this is seldom or never
          wanting. Thus we know that Dungi (about 2650 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>) was deified, as were
          also Bûr-Sin, Gimil-Sin, and Ibi-Sin. This custom seems to have
          been continued until later times, for Rim-Sin of Larsa, the
          opponent of Ḫammurabi or Amraphel, was thus honoured, and even
          Ḫammurabi himself, who never has this divine prefix before his
          name, was sometimes paid this exceptional tribute, as such names as
          Ḫammurabi-Šamši, <span class="tei tei-q">“Hammurabi is my
          Sun,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“my Sun-god,”</span> show.
          The East was ever the home of flattery, which could hardly reach a
          higher point than that of deification.</p>

          generally in a very incomplete state, nevertheless show that this
          most successful king paid every attention to the welfare of his
          subjects, even those in distant parts of the country. Thus in one
          of these communications he gives instructions to Sin-idinnam (who
          was apparently military governor of Larsa or Ellasar) to pronounce
          judgment against a certain person who laid claim to a field.
          Another letter to the same person refers to grain taken by
          Awel-îli, concerning which the king says, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I have seen these reports. The grain of the recorder
          (?), which Awel-îli has taken, let him return to the
          recorder.”</span> In another place he writes to his officer rather
          angrily because Inuḫ-samar, apparently Sin-idinnam's lieutenant,
          had taken away from Sin-magir certain documents signed by the king.
          He asks Sin-idinnam why he had done this (placing the blame
          directly upon him), and concludes, <span class="tei tei-q">“The
          documents, the property of Sin-magir ... with the impress of my
          seal, which thou hast taken, restore to him.”</span> If Sin-idinnam
          had not been a very high-placed official, he would in all
          probability have been dismissed.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following is
          a letter from king Ammi-ṭitana to his agent—</p>

          Sippar-Ya'rurum concerning the wool ordered from him, to cause (it)
          to be sent to Babylon, but he has not caused the wool ordered from
          him to be sent.”</span> Thus he informs me. Why hast thou not
          caused the wool <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page166">[pg

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will thus be
          seen that the early kings of Babylonia identified themselves with
          the people of the country over which they ruled much more than the
          sovereigns of Europe have for many hundreds of years been
          accustomed to do. More than this—their families were accustomed to
          intermarry with the people, as did Elmešu—<span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is not only
          a curious document—it is also an interesting one, and shows under
          what conditions a woman of royal blood and race could in ancient
          Babylonia be wedded to a commoner. To all appearance the king
          himself, Elmešu's father, had nothing <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page167">[pg 167]</span><a name="Pg167" id="Pg167" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> to do with the transaction—perhaps he
          purposely held aloof—and this being the case, it is the bride's
          brother and sister who have charge of the ceremony and contract;
          and, with the bridegroom's father and mother, marry her as consort
          to Ibku-Annunitum. The wording differs from that used in ordinary
          cases, and is more elegant and select. A wedding-gift of four
          shekels of silver is hardly, perhaps, what one would expect to be
          made to a royal bride, but perhaps it was the customary amount in
          such cases. The penalty if the husband afterwards divorced his wife
          was, as usual, a money-payment, but the amount is doubtful, though
          it seems to be above the average. The penalty if Elmešu forsook her
          husband is unfortunately wanting by the mutilation of the document,
          but in ordinary cases it was generally death.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally, the
          members of the king's family were rich, and had a tendency to
          <span class="tei tei-q">“add field to field,”</span> for their own
          advantage. Or they would, like other people of means, hire land

          not quite clear without a little explanation. The grain advanced
          was, to all appearance, from the storehouse of the temple of the
          Sun-god at Sippara, and Iltani, as a sun-devotee, seems to have had
          it at her disposal for the benefit of the temple. In any case, the
          amount came from her, and was received by Šeritum, who seems to
          have been the reaper referred to. He promises to come to do the
          work in Adar, that very month, when the grain would have to be
          reaped, and the penalty for failing to fulfil his contract was
          apparently slavery. Evidently the work was urgent.</p>

          to say, that interesting as these texts are, they are very
          incomplete, and leave a great deal to the imagination, and still
          more altogether unrecorded. Nevertheless, they are very valuable as
          far as they go, and show us the royal family of Babylonia at the
          time working among the people as members of the community. Each
          one, however, evidently worked for his or her own interest, or for
          the interest of the religious community to which he or she
          belonged, and not for the people at large. It was only the king who
          worked for his people, and he did it, it is hardly going too far to
          say, because it was his interest to do so. Most people, however,
          acted for their own interest in those days, as now.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all
          probability the Babylonians consisted of what may be called the
          original Semites of that tract, with the Akkadians, also
          aboriginal, with whom they lived and had already, at the time of
          the dynasty of Babylon, mingled to such an extent that they must
          have become a homogeneous people, notwithstanding the racial
          differences which were probably noticeable at certain points—for
          example, a more strongly-marked Semitic type at Sippar and in that
          neighbourhood, and a more strongly-marked Akkadian type in the
          State to which Lagaš belonged. Other invasions, however, seem to
          have taken place, the principal being that of the Amorites, to
          which allusion has already been made—an invasion which the tablets
          of this period indicate to have been sufficiently numerous, and
          which must have left its mark on the population, to all appearance
          increasing the Semitic preponderance, and emphasizing the type. The
          existence of an <span class="tei tei-q">“Amorite tract”</span> in
          the district of Sippar, and the fact that Sin-idinnam, Ḫammurabi's
          general, is designated by the characters GAL-MAR-TU, in Semitic
          Babylonian <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Rab-Amurrî</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“chief of the Amorite(s),”</span> are in themselves
          sufficient testimony to this invasion. It is noteworthy, too, that
          the dynasty to which Ḫammurabi belonged is apparently that
          described by Berosus as <span class="tei tei-q">“Arabic,”</span> in
          which case we should have to recognize yet another invasion of
          Semites; but there is just the probability, that <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Arabic”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Amorite”</span> were interchangeable terms, the
          Amorites being regarded as a collection of wandering hordes of whom
          a portion entered the country, and took possession of the
          government. In any case, they shared the fate of all invaders of
          the kind referred to, for they were speedily conquered by the
          superior civilization of the conquered, and became so naturalized
          that notwithstanding their <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class=

          Babylonians <span class="tei tei-q">“the dynasty of
          Babylon.”</span> This Amorite element was to all appearance a
          sufficiently large one, as the more easily recognizable names show.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally other
          nationalities than the Babylonians, Akkadians, Šumerians, and
          Amorites were represented in the country—Elamites from the
          invasions of earlier centuries, Kassites and Sutites who came, in
          all probability, to trade, Qutites or Gutians brought into the
          country as slaves, or possibly living there as freemen—all these
          and others helped to increase the confusion of tongues which
          existed in the land from remote ages, and reminded people of the
          legend of the Tower of Babel, when <span class="tei tei-q">“the
          Lord did there confound the language of all the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Documents of an
          earlier date than those now under our notice indicate that
          Babylonian civilization goes back no less than three thousand years
          before the period of the dynasty of Babylon, and this, in
          consideration of the date calculated for the foundation of Niffer
          (another three thousand years earlier), must be regarded as a
          moderate estimate. Babylonian civilization was already, at the time
          now treated of, exceedingly <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> ancient. The early village settlement of
          primitive houses, clustered around an equally
          primitively-constructed temple, had grown into a large city, with
          many fanes therein. The scattered outlying smaller villages around
          this primitive settlement had gradually been incorporated with it,
          and formed its suburbs, each retaining its ancient name. Villages
          of more recent foundation were scattered all over the land, and the
          whole country was instinct with national life, due to the increase
          of importance which the comparatively recent union of several small
          states in a single large and therefore powerful kingdom had brought
          into existence.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus we find
          Babylonia at the period of the dynasty of Babylon. It could even
          then look back into a past stretching back into a remote and dim
          antiquity. Its laws, manners, customs, and religion were already
          old, and were our knowledge of this interesting period complete, we
          should probably find that there was much that was excellent in
          their laws, and interesting and instructive in the administration
          of those laws, as well as in their manners and customs with regard
          to legal matters in general.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Something of
          what the tablets of the period are able to inform us concerning the
          sacred person of the king and the position of his family has
          already been treated of, and we have now to turn to the next in the
          social scale—the people of the middle class. To this class belonged
          the priests, the leaders of the troops, the landowners, the
          employers of labour, the scribes, the physicians, the land-hirers,
          and the small farmers. In all probability artists and artisans also
          formed part of it, though their position may have been sometimes as
          bad as that of many who toiled in servitude, for the slaves seem,
          on the whole, to have been exceedingly well treated.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to
          the scribes at least, the head and beard were shaven, they wore a
          simple garment like <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg
          172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a
          toga thrown over the left shoulder, leaving the right arm free, and
          in all probability had on their feet no shoes, but sandals, though
          this point is doubtful.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A member of this
          upper class was polite in his address. When he wrote to a friend,
          whether on business or otherwise, he said, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“to so and so, whom Merodach preserve,”</span> and
          after saying who it was who was writing, added, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“may the Sun-god and Merodach grant thee to live for
          length of days—mayest thou have peace, mayest thou have life, may

          the reason, their influence being, at this time, to all appearance,

          envelope of the tablet as follows: <span class="tei tei-q">“And
          Ibni-Šamaš may beget sons, and Arad-Išḫara shall share like

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The names of ten

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this case the
          reason for the adoption of Arad-Išḫara probably was, that
          Ibni-Šamaš had no sons, though there was a possibility that he
          would have some later on.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
          refers to the adoption of a daughter, which was also a common

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though the
          inscription is short, it is sufficient to suggest that Nûr-Sin
          adopted Karanatum for some special reason, though what that reason
          may have been is uncertain. Probably it was in order that she
          should accompany Damiqtum as second wife of a man who wished to
          marry two women, as in the case of Iltani and Taram-Sagila.</p>

          referring to adoption are, however, very numerous, and do not

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus, in
            varying ways, did the ancient Babylonians live and wed, adopt
            children and inherit. Other incidents were there in their lives
            also, as when a man divorced his wife—an unpleasant experience
            for them both, in all probability—though often enough this must
            have taken place to the great joy of one or the other, or
            possibly of both, for it must have been a much less solemn thing
            with them than with us—the marriage tie. It is gratifying to know
            that documents referring to divorce are comparatively rare,
            though they are to be met with sometimes, as the following text

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sometimes the
          even tenor of early Babylonian life was interrupted by a lawsuit on
          the part of a relative (often one who ought to have known better),
          and, though less of a family convulsion than a divorce, it must
          have been sufficiently annoying, especially when the plaintiff was
          one's own father. The following gives details of such a case—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“(Tablet concerning) one slave, her maid, whom Ayatia,
          her mother, left to Ḫulaltum, her daughter, and Ḫulaltum (on that
          account) supported Ayatia, her mother. And Sin-naṣir (was) husband
          of Ayatia. Ayatia left to her (Ḫulaltum), in the 20th year, that
          which was in the city Buzu, but there was no tablet (?)
          (documentary evidence) concerning Ayatia's property. After Ayatia
          died, Sin-naṣir brought an action against Ḫulaltum on account of
          the maidservant, and Išarlim, scribe of the city of Sippar and the
          court (?) of Sippar, caused them to receive judgment. He declared
          him (Sin-naṣir) to be in the wrong. He is not again to bring action
          in the matter. (They have invoked) the spirit of Šamaš, Merodach,
          and Ḫammurabi. Judgment of Išarlim; Awat-Šamaš, the merchant;
          Itti-Bêl-kinni; Bûr-Sin; Gimil-bani. Month Adar, year of the canal

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many documents
          of this kind exist, though people did not generally bring actions
          against their own (step-) daughters, as Sin-naṣir is recorded as
          having done. The ancient Babylonians were at all times, however,
          very keen in standing up for their own rights, and went to law on
          the slightest provocation. The following records a claim upon some
          property, and its issue, which was as unsuccessful as that
          translated above—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          against. He shall not bring action, and Sin-êribam shall not again
          lay claim to the house of Šumu-râḫ.</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is noteworthy
          that the name of the first of the twelve witnesses attached to the
          document is Ya'kub-ilu, or Jacob-el, which is supposed to be
          connected with the name of the patriarch Jacob.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As in these
          days, many a man in those ancient times, for the better conducting
          of his business, would enter into partnership. As usual, all would
          go well for a time, but at last, in consequence of disagreements or
          disputes or some unpleasantness, they would decide to part. Several
          texts of this class exist, of which the following is a typical
          example—</p>

          judgment. They give back their capital, and receive back their

          same in both documents speaks in favour of this.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Babylonia, as
          in all the ancient East, there was the great blot upon their
          civilization which has not even at the present time, the dawn of
          the twentieth century, disappeared from the earth, namely, that of
          slavery. Throughout the long ages over which Babylonian domestic
          literature extends, the student finds this to be always present,
          and one of the most striking examples is contained in the following
          document, which exhibits the blot with all its possible
          horrors—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          Šamaš-nûri says to Bêlisunu, her mistress, <span class=

          her hair, and sell her for silver. As the complete price he has

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That a father
          should part with his daughter for <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          become the wife of a man already married, agreeing at the same time
          that the young woman should become the slave of the first wife,
          would seem to the ordinary Western mind at the present day most
          barbarous. That it was not the lowest depth, however, is implied by
          the condition attached to the contract, and containing a kind of
          penalty, namely, that if the new wife denied that the first wife
          was her mistress, she might be sold as a slave. In what her
          position differed from that of a thrall, however, does not
          appear.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally the
          case of Hagar, the slave of Sarah, Abraham's wife, will at once
          occur to the reader, though the two differ somewhat. Nevertheless,
          it is not improbable that the well-known Bible-story explains that
          of the tablet, in giving a reason for the purchase of
          Šamaš-nûri—namely, in order to give the purchaser, Bunini-âbi, a
          chance of having offspring, which, in all probability, his first
          wife Bêlisunu had not brought him. It is difficult to imagine that
          she would consent to the introduction of a rival for any other
          reason. Of course, the new wife may have been well treated, but a
          transaction of the kind here recorded naturally gave an opening to
          all possible abuses. Another case of the taking of a second wife,
          with the proviso that she is to be the servant of the first, is
          that of Iltani (see pp. <a href="#Pg174" class=
          "tei tei-ref">174-175</a>), who, however, was not a slave, and had
          a regular marriage-deed. Moreover, she is described as the sister
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          and her child—</p>

          not only hired from their masters and themselves, but also from
          their fathers, mothers, brothers, and whoever else might have
          charge of them. There are also lists of workmen hired for various
          purposes in batches. Those who went about doing reaping seem to
          have been of various nationalities, and interesting names are on
          that account found in the lists from time to time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all
          probability the towns at that early period resembled closely those
          of the Semitic East at the present day, the streets being as a rule
          narrow (from the necessity of obtaining protection from the
          excessive heat of the sun during the hot season) and exceedingly
          dirty. This is shown by the excavations at Niffer, where, at the
          earliest period, when the street in question was constructed, the
          houses were entered by going up a few steps. Later on, in
          consequence of the accumulations, the footpath became level with
          the floor of the house, and, at a later period still, a
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name=
          "Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> little staircase had
          to be built leading down into the building. As may easily be
          imagined, the conditions in which the ancient Babylonians lived
          were in the highest degree insanitary, and such as would probably
          not be tolerated for a day in Europe at the present time.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Judging from the
          remains of private houses which have been found, these buildings
          were not by any means large. In fact, they must have contained only
          a few small rooms. Where, however, there was space—as, for example,
          when the house was built in the middle of a field—the rooms were
          probably moderately large, and more numerous. They were of either
          unburnt or burnt brick, and the roofs were supported by beams. The
          floors seem to have been generally the bare earth.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many lists of
          the furniture of these dwelling-places are extant, and allow us to
          estimate to a certain extent the amount of comfort which their
          inhabitants enjoyed. They reclined upon couches, and
          sometimes—perhaps often—it happened that the owner of the house
          possessed several of these articles of furniture. Apparently, too,
          it was their custom to sit upon chairs, and not upon the ground, as
          they do in the East at the present day, and have done for many
          centuries. Various vessels, of wood, earthenware, and copper, were
          also to be found there, together with measures of different
          kinds,<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href=
          "#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>
          implements needed in the trade of the owner, and certain objects of
          stone. In some cases things of precious stone are referred to, a
          circumstance which points to a considerable amount of prosperity on
          the part of the owner of the house and its
          contents.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg
          190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As will be seen
          farther on, when Babylonian life of a later period comes to be
          treated of, the leasehold system, with all its disadvantages, was
          in full force, and there is just the possibility that it was
          already in use during the time of the dynasty of Babylon. Even at
          this early date the question of party walls was an important one,
          as the tablet of Šamaš-în-mâtim and Êrišti-Aa, daughter of Zililum,
          shows. They were to set up the dividing wall (<span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">gušuru</span></span>, apparently palings)
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">aḫum
          mala aḫim</span></span>, lit. <span class="tei tei-q">“brother as
          much as brother,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> one as much as the other.
          They managed things differently in ancient Babylonia, and if this
          was the usual arrangement, it must have given rise to endless
          disputes.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is probable
          that, before the time of Ḫammurabi, the ancient Babylonians had no
          code of laws in the true sense of the term. All the legal decisions
          known seem to have been decided on their merits by the judges who
          tried the cases, and in such actions in which the judges could not
          come to a decision, the matter seems to have been referred to the
          king, whose word was, to all appearance, final. Naturally an
          enormous responsibility rested on the judges on account of this,
          but they were not entirely without help in the matter of deciding
          difficult and unusual questions. Lists of precedents were kept, and
          to these, in all probability, they constantly referred—indeed, the
          tablets of legal precedents were held in such high esteem, that
          copies of them were kept in the libraries of Assyria, and in
          Babylonia also, in all probability, until long after the
          destruction of the Assyrian power, notwithstanding that legal use
          and wont had by that time somewhat changed. One or two examples of
          these legal precedents may here be quoted to show their
          nature:—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          house.</span></p>

          away, gets locked up, or falls ill, he shall pay as his hire every
          day half a measure of grain.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus did the
          ancient Babylonians punish those who offended against their laws,
          and protect property (for the slave-hirer was undoubtedly saddled
          with a heavy responsibility). Was it that the death of a hired
          slave was regarded as testifying to the severity of his temporary
          hirer? In all probability it was so, and in that case, one cannot
          help regarding the law as a wise one. To all appearance, also,
          illness was attributed to his employer's cruelty. As to his running
          away, or falling into the hands of the police, these things would
          prove that his employer was not watchful enough with regard to him.
          A modern European lawyer would most likely not regard this
          particular law as being very exactly worded (there is no limit of
          time during which the slave's wages were payable, and one can only
          <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">guess</span></em> that the term of his service
          with his hirer was understood), but there seems to be no doubt as
          to its intention—to safeguard the slave, and his owner at the same
          time, by making his hirer responsible for every mishap and accident
          which might happen to him whilst he was with his temporary
          master.</p>

        presence of his father Terah in the land of his nativity, in Ur of
        the Chaldees, and afterwards Terah took Abram his son, Lot, his
        grandson, and Sarai, his son Abram's wife, and they went forth from
        Ur of the Chaldees to go to Canaan. Arriving at Haran, they dwelt
        there until Terah died at an exceedingly advanced age.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There have been
        many discussions as to the position of Ur of the Chaldees. Some, on
        account of the distance from Canaan, apparently, have contended that
        Ur of the Chaldees is the same as the site known for many hundreds of
        years as Urfa, in Mesopotamia—the district in which the proto-martyr,
        St. Stephen (Acts vii. 2, 41), places it. Mesopotamia, however, is an
        appellation of wide extent, and altogether insufficiently precise to
        enable the exact locality to be determined. To all appearance,
        though, Urfa or Orfa, called by the Greeks Edessa, was known as Orrha
        at the time of Isidore of Charax (date about 150 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>). Pocock, in his
        Description of the East, states that it is the universal opinion of
        the Jews that Orfa or Edessa was the ancient Ur of the Chaldees, and
        this is supported by local tradition, the chief place of worship
        there being called <span class="tei tei-q">“the Mosque of
        Abraham,”</span> and the pond in which the sacred fish are
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193"
        id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> kept being called <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Bahr Ibrahím
        el-Halíl</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lake of Abraham
        the Beloved.”</span> The tradition in the Talmud and in certain early
        Arabian writers, that Ur of the Chaldees is Warka, the Ὀρχόη of the
        Greeks, and Ὀρέχ of the Septuagint, need not detain us, as this site
        is certainly the Erech of Gen. x. 10, and is excluded by that
        circumstance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Two other
        possibilities remain, the one generally accepted by Assyriologists,
        the other tentatively put forward by myself some years ago. The
        former has a series of most interesting traditions to support it, the
        latter simply a slightly greater probability. The reader may adopt
        that which seems to him best to suit the circumstances of the
        case.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The identification
        generally accepted is, that Ur of the Chaldees is the series of
        mounds now called Mugheir, or, more in accordance with correct
        pronunciation, Muqayyar, <span class="tei tei-q">“the pitchy,”</span>
        from the noun <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">qír</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“pitch,”</span> that material having been largely used in
        the construction of the buildings whose ruins occupy the site. The
        identification of these ruins with those of Ur-kasdim or Ur of the
        Chaldees was first proposed by Sir Henry Rawlinson in 1855, on the
        ground that the name of the city on the bricks found there, which he
        read Hur, resembled that of the name as given in Gen. xi. 28 and 31.
        As a matter of fact, the Semitic Babylonian form of the name
        approaches even nearer than the celebrated Assyriologist then
        thought, for it is given in the bilingual texts as <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Uru</span></span>.
        The Akkadian form (which is most probably the more ancient of the
        two), on the other hand, is not so satisfactory, as it contains an
        additional syllable, the full form being <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Uriwa</span></span> (the vowel before the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">w</span></em> only is a little doubtful). This,
        with the absence of any addition corresponding to the Hebrew
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Kasdim</span></span>, is the principal flaw in
        what would otherwise be a perfect philological comparison.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ur or Uriwa, the
        modern Mugheir, is situated <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus does the poet
        of ancient days, in a composition in the non-Semitic idiom of his
        time, lament the misfortunes which had come over the temple and
        city—how, whether by was by famine, or by some other mischance, we
        know not. It serves to show, however, not only the poetical spirit
        which animated the Akkadians at the time, but also the high esteem in
        which the temple and the deities venerated therein were held, and the
        power attributed to the Moon-god in the centre of his worship. The
        fact that Ur (Mugheir) was an important place for the worship of the
        Moon-god has been not seldom quoted in support of the identity of
        this city with Ur of the Chaldees, because Haran, the city to which
        Abram migrated with his father Terah, was also a centre of the
        worship of Sin. This, in itself, is not at all improbable, the Jewish
        tradition being, that Terah was an idolater.<a id="noteref_34" name=
        "noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> That Terah should go 560 miles
        simply for this reason, when he might have found a suitable
        settlement nearer, seems to be in the highest degree unlikely, minor
        shrines of the Moon-god being, in all probability, far from rare in
        Babylonia.<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href=
        "#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a> He
        simply sojourned there because, in his journeyings, it suited him to
        stay there. If he were a devotee of the Moon-god, he was in all
        probability the more pleased to take up his abode there. But he may
        not have worshipped that divinity at all, or if he did do so, may not
        have honoured him more than the Sun-god, Anu, the god of the heavens,
        or the goddess Ištar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many legends
        concerning Abram—legends of sufficiently high antiquity—exist, but
        how far they are trustworthy must always be a matter of opinion. In
        any case, the writers had the advantage—if advantage it was—of living
        2000 years nearer to Abraham's time than we have. Thus Eupolemus (as
        has already been pointed out on p. <a href="#Pg146" class=
        "tei tei-ref">146</a>) states, that in the tenth generation, in the
        city of Babylonia called Camarina (which by some is called Urie, and
        which signifies a city of the Chaldeans), there lived, the thirteenth
        in descent, Abraham, a man of a noble race, and superior to all
        others in wisdom. They relate of him that he was the inventor of
        astrology and Chaldean magic, and that on account of his eminent
        piety he was esteemed by God. It is said, moreover, that under the
        direction of God he departed and lived in Phœnicia, and there taught
        the Phœnicians the motions of the sun and moon, and all other things,
        and was on that account held in great reverence by their king.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All this,
        naturally, points to Babylonia and the city of Uru or Uriwa as the
        original dwelling-place of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg
        197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Abram, Camarina being connected with the Arabic <span lang="ar"
        class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="ar"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">qamar</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the moon,”</span> which, as we have seen, was the deity
        worshipped there. It is noteworthy that the transcription of the
        Babylonian name of the city, Urie, contains traces of the Akkadian
        termination <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">-iwa</span></span> (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Uriwa</span></span>) which is absent in the
        Hebrew form Ur. This is important, as it shows that at a
        comparatively late date (Eupolemus lived just before the Christian
        era), the ending in question made itself felt in the transcription of
        the word, and that the form in Genesis, Ur, does not quite agree, as
        traces of that termination (two syllables in the Akkadian form) are
        altogether wanting in it. There can be no doubt, therefore, that the
        theory that Abram lived and passed his earlier years at the Ur which
        is now represented by the ruins of Mugheir, originated with the Jews
        during their captivity at Babylon and in the cities of Babylonia.
        Eupolemus, as a student of Jewish history, would naturally get his
        information from a Jewish source, and the Jews had, in common with
        most of the nations of the earth, a tendency to attribute to their
        own forefathers, whom they venerated so highly, the glory of being
        connected with any renowned city or great discovery of earlier ages.
        Thus it arises that Eupolemus, following his Jewish informant, makes
        Abraham to be the inventor of astrology and Chaldean magic; and to
        have dwelt at Ur. It must have been the Jewish captives exiled in
        Babylonia who first identified Ur with the renowned city Uru or
        Uriwa, quite forgetting that the form of the name could not have been
        Ur in Hebrew, and that there was another Ur, much more suitable as
        the dwelling-place of a nomad family like that of Terah and his sons,
        namely, the country of Akkad itself, called, in the non-Semitic
        idiom, Uri or Ura, a tract which included the whole of northern
        Babylonia.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In whatever part
        of Babylonia, however, the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg
        198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        patriarch may have sojourned, of one thing there is no doubt, and
        that is, that if he dwelt there, the life which he saw around him,
        and in which he must have taken part, was that depicted by the
        tablets translated in the foregoing chapter. He saw the idolatry of
        the people, and the ceremonies and infamies which accompanied it; he
        saw the Babylonians as they were in his day, with all their faults,
        and all their virtues—their industry, their love of trade, their
        readiness to engage in litigation, and all the other interesting
        characteristics which distinguished them. He must have been
        acquainted with their legends of the Creation, the Flood, and all
        their gods and heroes, and the poetry for which the Hebrew race has
        always been renowned must have had its origin in the land of Nimrod,
        whence Abraham of old went forth free, and his descendants, a
        millennium and a half later, returned as captives.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How it came about
        (if it be really true) that Terah was an idolater, whilst his son
        Abram was a monotheist, will probably never be known. It is only
        reasonable to suppose, however, that among a people so intelligent as
        the Babylonians, there were at least some who, thinking over the
        nature of the world in which they lived and the destiny of mankind,
        saw that the different gods whom the people worshipped could not all
        be governors of the universe, but, if they existed at all, must be
        only manifestations of the Deity who held the supreme power. Indeed,
        it was, to all appearance, this doctrine which really prevailed, as
        is shown by the text translated on p. <a href="#Pg058" class=
        "tei tei-ref">58</a>. Whether taught generally to the learned class
        (the scribes) or not, is not known, but it must have been very
        commonly known to those who could read, otherwise it is hardly likely
        that such a tablet would have been drawn up and written out again at
        a later date (the text we possess being but a copy of a lost
        original). As the divinity with whom the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page199">[pg 199]</span><a name="Pg199" id="Pg199" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> others are identified is Merodach, it is most
        likely that this special doctrine of the unity of the Deity became
        general some time after the commencement of the Dynasty of Babylon
        (that to which Ḫammurabi or Amraphel belonged), when the city of
        Babylon became the capital of the country. Abram's monotheism would,
        therefore, naturally fit in with the new doctrine which apparently
        became the general belief of the learned class at this time.<a id=
        "noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Concerning the
        journey of Abraham, there is naturally nothing to be said, the Bible
        narrative merely stating that Terah and his family migrated to Haran.
        The only thing worth noting is, that the distance they had to travel
        was sufficiently great—about 560 miles from Uriwa (Mugheir), and
        about 420 miles from Babylon, from the neighbourhood of which the
        family must have started if the Ur mentioned in Genesis be the Uri or
        Ura of the inscriptions, which was equivalent to the land of Akkad.
        The whole of this district was, in all probability, at this time, as
        later, under Babylonian rule, a state of things which must have
        contributed in some measure to the safe transit of the household to
        Haran, and also that of Abraham later on to Canaan, which, as we know
        from the inscriptions<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href=
        "#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a> and from
        Gen. xiv., acknowledged Babylonian overlordship.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to
        Haran, it is very probable that this ancient city was, by turns,
        under the rule either of Babylonia or Assyria until the absorption of
        the former power into the great Persian Empire, when Haran likewise,
        in all probability, shared the same fate. Concerning the early
        history of the city very little is known, but it is not improbable
        that it was <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg
        200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> an
        ancient Babylonian foundation, the name being apparently the
        Babylonian word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ḫarranu</span></span>, meaning <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“road.”</span> The name given to this <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“road-city”</span> is explained as originating in the
        fact, that it lay at the junction of several trade-routes—an
        explanation which is very probable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The city itself
        was, at the time of its greatest prosperity, a considerable place, as
        the remains now existing show. There are the ruins of a castle, with
        square columns 8 feet thick, supporting a roof of 30 feet high,
        together with some comparatively modern ruins. The ancient walls,
        though in a very dilapidated state, are said to be continuous
        throughout. No houses remain, but there are several ruins, one of
        great interest, and considerable extent, which Ainsworth considered
        to be a temple. A rudely sculptured lion, found outside the walls, is
        regarded as giving evidence of Assyrian occupation, which, however,
        is otherwise known to have been an historical fact.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Abraham's time
        the place had, in all probability, not attained its fullest
        development, and must have been a small city. The plain in which it
        is situated is described as very fertile, but not cultivated to its
        fullest extent, on account of half the land remaining fallow because
        not manured. This, at least, was the state of the tract 72 years ago,
        but it is very probable that, in the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“changeless East,”</span> the same description applies at
        the present day. That it was of old, as now, a fertile spot, may be
        gathered from the fact that the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser I.
        speaks of having taken or killed elephants in that district—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If there were
        elephants in <span class="tei tei-q">“the land of Haran”</span> 1100
        years before Christ, it is very probable that they were to be found
        in the neighbourhood a thousand years earlier, but notwithstanding
        any disadvantage which may have been felt from the presence of these
        enormous beasts, it was in all probability a sufficiently safe
        district for one possessing flocks and herds. There is no reason to
        suppose that the presence of elephants around Haran in any way
        influenced the patriarch to leave the place, for these animals were
        to be found (according to an inscription supposed to have been
        written for the same Assyrian king, Tiglath-pileser I.) in Lebanon,
        and therefore in the country where Abraham settled after quitting
        Haran.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As has already
        been noted, this was the centre of the worship of the Moon-god Sin or
        Nannaru,<a id="noteref_38" name="noteref_38" href=
        "#note_38"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">38</span></span></a> and
        Terah and his family, in settling in this place, doubtless saw the
        same ceremonies in connection with the worship of this deity as they
        had been accustomed to see in Babylonia, slightly modified; and this
        would be the case whether Terah's family came from Uriwa or not, the
        Moon-god being worshipped in more cities than one in Babylonia.
        Something of the importance of the shrine of Nannaru at Haran may be
        gathered from the fact, that the Assyrian king Esarhaddon (to all
        appearance) was crowned there. As the text recording this is very
        interesting, and reveals something of the beliefs of the Assyrians
        and the natives of Haran, I quote here the passage referring to the
        ceremony, restoring the wording where defective. The writer is
        apparently addressing Aššur-banî-âpli, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        great and noble Asnapper”</span>—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“When the father of the king my lord went to Egypt, he
        was crowned (?) in the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-q">‘Bethel’</span>) of cedar. The god Sin
        remained over the (sacred) standard, two crowns upon <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202"

        "tei tei-q">‘Thou shalt go and capture the lands in the
        midst.’</span> (He we)nt, he captured the land of Egypt. The rest of
        the lands not submitting (?) to Aššur and Sin, the king, the lord of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In addition to the
        god Sin, the above extract refers to the deity known as Nusku, as
        being venerated there. That this was the case, is confirmed by
        several inscriptions of the time of Aššur-banî-âpli, who seems to
        have restored his temple. This fane, which the Assyrian king is said
        to have made to shine like the day, was called Ê-melam-anna,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the temple of the glory of heaven,”</span>
        and the presence of its name in a list of the temples of Babylonia
        and Assyria testifies to its importance.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The temple of Sin
        or Nannaru, as we learn from the inscriptions of Nabonidus, was
        called Ê-ḫulḫul, <span class="tei tei-q">“the temple of (great)
        joy.”</span> The fane having been destroyed by the Medes, Nabonidus
        received, in a dream, command to rebuild it, and it is interesting to
        learn that, when the work was in progress, the records which
        Aššur-banî-âpli had placed there, according to custom, when restoring
        it, came to light. The letter of which an extract is given above was
        probably written to the Assyrian king upon this occasion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">So renowned was
        the place as a centre of heathen worship, that at a comparatively
        late date—running far into the Christian era, namely, the fifth
        century <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">a.d.</span></span>—the worship of heathen
        deities was still in full progress there, though the god Sin had
        fallen, to all appearance, somewhat into the background, and
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203"

        Sun-god, generally known as Shamash or Samas, and called later on by
        the Greek name of Helios, had taken his place. They also worshipped a
        goddess called Gadlat, generally identified with the Babylonian
        goddess Gula, and Atargatis, the feminine counterpart of Hadad, whose
        name is often found in Aramean inscriptions under the form of
        'Atar-'ata.<a id="noteref_40" name="noteref_40" href=
        "#note_40"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        goddess is called Derketo<a id="noteref_41" name="noteref_41" href=
        "#note_41"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">41</span></span></a> by
        Ktesias, and appears as Tar-'ata in Syriac and in the Talmud.
        According to Baethgen, Atargatis, or, better, Attargatis, was a
        double divinity, composed of Ištar and 'Ata or 'Atta (Attes). In
        consequence of the worship of the sun, the moon, and the planet Venus
        ('Atar = Ištar), a second centre of the worship denominated Sabean
        (which originated in south-west Arabia, the country of the Sabeans)
        was founded in Haran, where its devotees are said to have had a
        chapel dedicated to Abraham, whose renown had, to all appearance,
        brought to his memory the great honour of deification.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was after a
        long sojourn at Haran that Abraham set out for his journey westwards,
        the patriarch being no less than seventy-five years old when he left
        that city. The next episode in his life was his journey, in obedience
        to the call which he had received, to Canaan, going first to Shechem,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“unto the oak (terebinth) of Moreh,”</span>
        afterwards to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and thence, later,
        towards the south. A famine caused him to continue his travels as far
        as Egypt, where the incident of Sarai being taken from him, in
        consequence of the deceit practised by him in describing her as his
        sister, took place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This portion of
        the patriarch's history is not one which can be very easily dealt
        with, the incident being <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg
        204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        told very shortly, and no Egyptian names being given—in fact, it is
        altogether destitute of <span class="tei tei-q">“local
        colouring”</span> necessarily so, from the brevity of the
        narrative.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At Haran, the
        patriarch and the members of his family probably saw people to a
        great extent of the type to which they had been accustomed in
        Babylonia, but in the land of Canaan they would notice some
        difference, though they all spoke a Semitic language, like
        themselves. Indeed, it is not at all improbable that wherever the
        ancestor of the Hebrews went, he found the Semitic Babylonian
        language at least understood, for as the Babylonian king claimed
        dominion over all this tract as far as the Mediterranean, the
        language of his country was fast becoming what it certainly was a few
        hundred years later, namely, the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">lingua
        franca</span></span> of the whole tract as far as Egypt, where also,
        to all appearance, Abraham and his wife had no difficulty in making
        themselves understood.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to Gen.
        x. 6, Canaan, into whose country Abraham journeyed with the object of
        settling, was the descendant of Cush, and the inhabitants ought
        therefore to have spoken a Hamitic language. Historically, however,
        this cannot be proved, but it is certain that if the Canaanites spoke
        a Hamitic language, they soon changed it for the speech which they
        seem to have used as far back as history can go, this speech being
        closely akin to Hebrew. In fact, there is very little doubt that
        Abraham and his descendants, forsaking their mother-tongue, the
        language of Babylonia, adopted the dialect of the Canaanitish
        language, which they afterwards spoke, and which is so well known at
        the present day as Hebrew. To all appearance Abraham's relatives, who
        remained in Mesopotamia, in <span class="tei tei-q">“the city of
        Nahor,”</span> spoke a dialect of Aramaic, a language with which
        Abraham himself must have been acquainted, and which may have been
        spoken in Babylonia at that early date, as it certainly was, together
        with Chaldean, later on.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page205">[pg
        205]</span><a name="Pg205" id="Pg205" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is noteworthy,
        that the country to which Abraham migrated, and which is called by
        the Hebrew writers Canaan, is called by the same name in the
        Tel-el-Amarna letters, and the fact that the Babylonian king
        Burra-buriaš uses the same term shows that it was the usual name in
        that part of the world. Among the Babylonians, however, it was called
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mât
        Amurrî</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the land of
        Amoria,”</span> the common expression, among the Babylonians and the
        Assyrians, for <span class="tei tei-q">“the West.”</span> In later
        times the Assyrians designated this district <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mât
        Ḫatti</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the land of
        Heth,”</span> the home of the Hittites. The inference from this
        naturally is, that at the time when the Babylonians became acquainted
        with the country, the Amorites were the most powerful nationality
        there, whilst the Hittites had the dominion, and were in greater
        force later on, when the Assyrians first traded or warred there.
        These two linguistic usages show, that the two great races in the
        country, both of them Hamitic, according to Gen. x. 15, 16, were the
        Amorites (who spread as far as Babylonia, and even had settlements
        there), and the Hittites, whose capital was Ḫattu (<span class=

        they occur on the tablets, such portions as may bear on the question
        of the knowledge of the Babylonians of the countries which lay around

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here follows a
        list of adjectives combined with the word for country, forming
        descriptions such as <span class="tei tei-q">“safe country,”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“low-lying country,”</span> etc.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the above list
        of countries, the land of the Amorites holds the first place, and is
        repeated three times, there having, to all appearance, been three
        ways of writing its name in Akkadian. Why this was the case—whether
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page207">[pg 207]</span><a name="Pg207"
        id="Pg207" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in the older Akkadian
        literature the scribes distinguished three different districts or
        not, is not known, but is not at all improbable. The first of the
        three ways of designating the country is the usual one, and
        apparently means the land of the Amorites in general, the other two
        being less used, and possibly indicating the more mountainous parts.
        What the mountains of Suru or Subartu were is uncertain, but it may
        be supposed that, as this group is used in the late Babylonian
        inscriptions (as shown by the text containing the account of the
        downfall of Assyria) for the domain over which the kings of Assyria
        ruled, there is hardly any doubt that it stands for the Mesopotamian
        tract, extending from the boundaries of the Amorites to the frontiers
        of Babylonia. This would include not only Assyria, but also
        Aram-naharaim, or Syria, and is in all probability the original of
        this last word, which has given considerable trouble to students to
        explain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all
        probability, Siru, like Gutium and the border of Gutium, was a tract
        in the neighbourhood of Elam, which precedes. A comparison has been
        made between this Sirum and the Sirrum of the eleventh line of the
        extract, but as the spelling, and also, seemingly, the pronunciation,
        is different, it is in all likelihood a different place. The mountain
        of Cedar, however, is probably Lebanon, celebrated of old, and
        sufficiently wooded, in the time of Aššur-naṣir-âpli, to give cover
        to droves of elephants, which the Assyrian king hunted there.
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        a country celebrated for its dogs. Concerning Bitala or Kaštala
        nothing is known, but Ḫanê is supposed to have lain near Birejik on
        the Orontes.<a id="noteref_42" name="noteref_42" href=

        which is apparently the same as <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Lulubū, was an adjoining state, which the
        Babylonians claim to have devastated about the twenty-eighth century
        before Christ, a fact which contributes to the confirmation of the
        antiquity of Babylonian geographical lore, and its trustworthiness,
        for the nation which invades another must be well aware of the
        position and physical features of territory invaded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is interesting
        to note, that one of the ordinary bilingual lists (W.A.I. II. pl. 48)
        gives what are apparently three mountainous districts, the first
        being Amurru, translating the Akkadian GIRGIR, which we are told to
        pronounce Tidnu (see above, pp. <a href="#Pg122" class=
        "tei tei-ref">122</a>, <a href="#Pg206" class="tei tei-ref">206</a>,
        and below, p. <a href="#Pg312" class="tei tei-ref">312</a>), the
        second Urṭū (Ararat), which we are told to pronounce in Akkadian
        Tilla, and the third Qutû, in Akkadian Gišgala šu anna, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the district with the high barriers,”</span> likewise a
        part of the Aramean mountains.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After returning
        from Egypt, Abraham went and dwelt in the south of Canaan, between
        Bethel and Ai, Lot quitting him in consequence of the quarrel which
        took place between their respective herdsmen. Concerning the
        Canaanite and the Perizzite, who were then in the land, the
        Babylonian inscriptions of this period, as far as they are known, say
        nothing, but there is hardly any doubt that these nationalities were
        known to them, this tract being within the boundaries of the
        Babylonian dominions. That these names do not yet occur, is not to be
        wondered at, for the Babylonians had been accustomed to call the
        tract Amurrū, and names which have been long attached to a country do
        not change at all easily. The next resting-place of the patriarch was
        by the oaks or terebinths of Mamre in Hebron, where he built an altar
        to the Lord.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this point
        occurs Gen. ch. xiv., which contains the description of the conflict
        of the four kings against five—evidently one of the struggles of the
        Amorites and their allies to throw off the yoke of the Babylonians,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209"
        id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> who were in this case assisted
        by several confederate states.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Much has been
        written concerning this interesting chapter of the Bible. The earlier
        critics were of opinion that it was impossible that the power of the
        Elamites should have extended so far at such an early epoch. Later
        on, when it was shown that the Elamites really had power—and that
        even earlier than the time of Abraham—the objection of the critics
        was, that none of the names mentioned in the fourteenth chapter of
        Genesis really existed in the inscriptions. The history of Abraham
        was a romance, and the names of the Eastern kings with whom he came
        into contact equally so. It was true that there were Elamite names
        commencing with the element Kudur, the Chedor of the sacred text, but
        Chedorlaomer did not occur, Amraphel and Tidal were equally wanting,
        and that Arioch was the same as Eri-Aku or Rim-Aku could not be
        proved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first step in
        solving the riddle was that made by Prof. Eberhard Schrader, who
        suggested that Amraphel was none other than the well-known Babylonian
        king Ḫammurabi. This, naturally, was a theory which did not soon find
        acceptance—at least by all the Assyriologists. There were, however,
        two things in its favour—this king ruled sufficiently near to the
        time of Abraham, and he overcame a ruler named Rim-Sin or Rim-Aku,
        identified by the late George Smith with the Arioch of the chapter we
        are now considering. Concerning the latter ruler, Rim-Aku, there is
        still some doubt, but the difficulties which attended the
        identification of Ḫammurabi with Amraphel have now practically
        disappeared. The first step was the discovery of the form Ammurabi in
        one of the numerous contracts drawn up during his reign at Sippara,
        the city of the Sun-god. This form shows that the guttural was not
        the hard guttural <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">kh</span></em>, but the softer <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></em>. Yet
        another step <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg
        210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        nearer the Biblical form is that given by Ašaridu, who, in a letter

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As this is a late
        reference to Ḫammurabi, it is noteworthy not only on account of the
        form the name (which agrees excellently with the Biblical Amraphel)
        had assumed at the time (the hard breathing or aspirate having to all
        appearance completely disappeared), but also as a testimony to the
        esteem in which he was held a millennium and a half after his death.
        How it is that the Hebrew form has <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">l</span></em> at the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211"
        id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> end is not known, but the
        presence of this letter has given rise to numerous theories. One of
        these is, that Amraphel is for <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ḫammurabi
        îlu</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ḫammurabi the
        god,”</span> many of the old Babylonian kings having been deified
        after their death. Another (and perhaps more likely) explanation is,
        that this additional letter is due to the faulty reading of a variant
        writing of the name, with a polyphonous character having the value of
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">pil</span></span> as well as <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bi</span></span>,—which form may, in fact, still
        be found. However the presence of the final (and apparently
        unauthorized) addition to the name be explained, the identification
        of Amraphel and Ḫammurabi is held to be beyond dispute.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thanks to
        important chronological lists of colophon-dates and to a number of
        trade-documents from Tel-Sifr, Sippara, and elsewhere, which are
        inscribed with the same dates in a fuller form, the outline of the
        history of the reign of Ḫammurabi is fairly well known, though it can
        hardly be said that we have what would be at the present time
        regarded as an important event for each year, notwithstanding that
        they may have been to the ancient Babylonians of all-absorbing
        interest. The following is a list of the principal dates of his

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Year 38, which, in
        the chronological list, is called the year of the great ... is
        possibly to be completed, in accordance with the indications from the
        colophon-dates: <span class="tei tei-q">“Year of Ḫammurabi the king
        (when) a great flood destroyed Ešnunna.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to the
        other undecided dates, it is practically certain that the three long
        ones—those which record the destruction of the wall of Mair and
        Malgia, the restoration of the temple Ê-me-temena-ursag and the
        temple tower dedicated to Zagaga, and the construction of the great
        dam of the Tigris—come into the gaps after the entry for the
        thirty-first year. The reason for this assumption is, that the
        thirty-first year of Ḫammurabi was the date of his conquest of
        Rîm-Sin, in whose dominions the town represented by the ruins of
        Tel-Sifr (the place whence the tablets came which bear these dates)
        lay. All the tablets from this place, bearing dates of the reign of
        Ḫammurabi, therefore belong to the thirty-first year of his reign and
        later.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all probability
        there is one thing that will be considered as noteworthy, and that
        is, that as far as our records go, there is no reference whatever to
        any expedition to the West-land, and if that be due simply to the
        imperfection of the records which have come down to us, all that can
        be said is, that it is a noteworthy coincidence.<a id="noteref_46"
        name="noteref_46" href="#note_46"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">46</span></span></a> It must
        not be supposed, however, that it in any wise invalidates the
        trustworthiness <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg
        215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        the narrative in the 14th chapter of Genesis—there is plenty of room
        in the mutilated list (of which I have given such a translation as is
        possible) for a date referring to this to have been recorded, though
        we must keep in mind the possibility, that if the Babylonian king
        considered that disaster had in any way overtaken his arms, he may
        not have recorded it at all. Then there is the fact, that the
        expedition was undertaken in conjunction with allies—Chedorlaomer,
        Tidal, and Arioch—for none of whom, in all probability, Ḫammurabi had
        any sympathy. The Elamite was a conqueror from a land over which the
        Babylonians of earlier ages had held sway, and Arioch had dominion
        over a neighbouring tract, to which Ḫammurabi himself laid claim, and
        over which, as the texts above translated show, he afterwards ruled.
        Ḫammurabi, moreover, claimed also the West-land—<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mât
        Amurrī</span></span>, the land of Amurrū—as his hereditary
        possession, and he found himself obliged to aid Chedorlaomer, Tidal,
        and Arioch to subjugate it—indeed, it was Chedorlaomer whom the five
        kings had acknowledged for twelve years as their overlord, and
        against whom, in the thirteenth, they rebelled. It is, therefore,
        likely that Ḫammurabi regarded himself as having been forced by
        circumstances to aid Chedorlaomer to reconquer what really belonged
        to Babylonia, and the probability that he would cause it to be used
        as one of the events to date by, is on that account still less, even
        if the news of any success which he might have considered himself
        entitled to reached his own domain in time to be utilized for such a
        purpose.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been shown
        on p. <a href="#Pg155" class="tei tei-ref">155</a> that Ammi-ṭitana,
        the third in succession from Ḫammurabi, claimed the sovereignty of
        the land of Amurrū, and from an inscription accompanying a portrait
        of Ḫammurabi discovered by Mr. Rassam, we learn that he, too, claimed
        sovereignty over it. Sargon of Agadé held <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> sway over the tract centuries before, so that
        he probably reckoned that, by right of inheritance, it was his. It
        would therefore be natural that he should omit to mention as an event
        to be remembered, an expedition to a country which ought never to
        have thrown off his dominion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of course, one of
        the principal things confirming the identification of Ḫammurabi with
        Amraphel would naturally be the occurrence of one or more of the
        names recorded in Gen. xiv., in conjunction with his, or in such a
        way that a connection could be established. This, naturally, is
        difficult, principally on account of our having no continuous history
        of the period to which these rulers belong. Nevertheless, a close
        examination of the inscriptions suggests in what way confirmation of
        the events narrated with reference to Amraphel and his allies might
        be sought.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Reference has
        already been made to Rîm-Sin, king of Yamutbālu (or Emutbālu), who
        appears to have been defeated by Ḫammurabi in the thirty-first regnal
        year. From this time the dominions of Rîm-Sin evidently formed part
        of the Babylonian Empire, and were never again separated from it as
        long as it existed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding
        the early identification of Rîm-Sin with Eri-Sin or Eri-Aku by the
        late George Smith, considerable doubt has been thrown on the identity
        of these two names by the fact, that in inscriptions containing the
        name of Kudur-mabuk, the father, the name of his son is written with
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Eri</span></span> as the first element—not
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Rîm</span></span>. This, it must be admitted, is
        a considerable difficulty. Winckler, however, in the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Keilinschriftliche
        Bibliothek</span></span>, Band III., 1 Hälfte, pp. 88-89, publishes a
        text given by Lenormant, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Textes Inédits</span></span>, No. 70, in which
        the name of the son of Kudur-mabuk is written Ri-im-Sin, and if this
        be correctly copied, it would seem to settle the matter of their
        identity. It is to be noted that they are both called <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> king of Uriwa, king of Larsa, and king of
        Šumer and Akkad. In the inscriptions Eri-Aku or Eri-Sin also calls
        himself <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">adda Emutbala</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“father of Yamutbālu,”</span> and, as the colophon-date
        of the 31st year of Ḫammurabi shows, Rîm-Sin or Rîm-Aku was also king
        of that region.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In these
        circumstances, there is hardly any doubt that they were at least
        closely connected, if not (as has been supposed since the time of the
        Assyriologist George Smith) actually identical. It is therefore
        worthy of mention, that M. F. Thureau-Dangin, the well-known French
        Assyriologist, suggests that Eri-Aku and Rîm-Sin were brothers, sons
        of Kudur-mabuk, and successively kings of Larsa (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Les Inscriptions de
        Šumer et d'Akkad</span></span>, p. 300, n. 3). This would not only
        account for their having the same parentage, but also for their
        claiming the same titles. It can therefore not be said, that
        Ḫammurabi became the enemy of his old ally—it was against his brother
        that he fought.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The date quoted on
        p. <a href="#Pg214" class="tei tei-ref">214</a> (year 31) seems to
        include Rîm-Sin in the capture of the land of Yamutbālum, but this is
        not confirmed by the new Chronicle, which states that Ḫammurabi, king
        of Babylon, gathered his soldiers and went against Rîm-Sin, king of
        Larsa. His hand captured Ur and Larsa, he carried off their goods to
        Babylon, and overthrew and carried away other things—what they were
        the mutilation of the record does not allow us even to guess. It is
        noteworthy also that the mention of Ur as one of the cities of
        Rîm-Sin shuts out that state from the tract which, from the 14th
        chapter of Genesis, would otherwise be included in Shinar, and seems
        also to explain why Ur is designated as being <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“of the Chaldees.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If, however, the
        colophon-date be right, and Rîm-Sin was really made prisoner, he must
        either have escaped, or been set at liberty again, for Samsu-iluna,
        son of Ḫammurabi, when he became king, had apparently <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to resist another attack on the part of
        that ruler, who seems to have been captured, and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“(? burnt) alive in his palace.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to the
        names Eri-Aku and Rîm-Sin, one Sumero-Akkadian, and the other
        Semitic, the former means, as was thought from the first,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Servant of the Moon-god,”</span> whilst the
        sense of the latter, as is made clear by the variant spelling in the
        new Babylonian chronicle, is <span class="tei tei-q">“Sin's (the
        Moon-god's) wild bull.”</span> A similar name is that of Rîm-Anu,
        another king of Larsa—<span class="tei tei-q">“Anu's (the
        Heaven-god's) wild bull.”</span> These are paralleled by such names
        as Bûr-Sin, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sin's young steer,”</span> in
        which the bearer is compared with a strong and willing animal of
        service. Possibly the substitution of the word for <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“wild bull”</span> in Rîm-Sin and Rîm-Anu is symbolical
        of reckless courage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Very little is
        known of the state of which Larsa (in Sumero-Akkadian Ararma) was the
        capital. It is interesting to note, however, that this city was a
        centre of the worship of the Sun-god Šamaš, as was also Sippar (now
        Abu-habbah). The temple in both cities bore the same name, Ê-bara
        (-para) or Ê-babbara (-barbara), <span class="tei tei-q">“the house
        of brilliant light.”</span> With the exception of Eri-Aku or Arioch,
        whose name is Sumero-Akkadian, all the rulers have Semitic
        names—Rîm-Anu, Nûr-Rammāni or Nûr-Addi, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“light of Rimmon”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“of
        Hadad,”</span> Sin-idinnam, <span class="tei tei-q">“Sin has
        given,”</span> and Rîm-Sin. If Eri-Aku was called, in the Semitic
        tongue, Arad-Sin, <span class="tei tei-q">“Servant of Sin,”</span> as
        is possible, this name must be added too, but in that case his
        identification with Arioch would be less probable. As he was of
        Elamite origin, his bearing a Sumero-Akkadian or a Semitic name was
        probably due to motives of policy, and one which, when written, could
        be read either way would give pleasure to both sections of the
        people, Sumero-Akkadian and Semitic.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This last text was
        found in the mound of Mugheir (Uriwa), and is of great interest, as
        it is dedicated to Ninsaḫ, the great messenger of the gods, and not
        to the god Sin or Nannara, the chief patron-deity of the city. It has
        also an interesting reference to the vine of Êridu (see pp. <a href=
        "#Pg071" class="tei tei-ref">71</a> ff.), and apparently to his
        capture of the city of Erech, delivered into his hands by the gods
        Anu, Bêl, and Ea. That he should represent <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> himself as taking possession of the city by the
        will of Anu, the chief god of the city, whose name he mentions before
        the other two divinities, sheds a certain light upon the character of
        the man, whilst his military exploits, both at home and in the west,
        must have made him, like Chedorlaomer his fellow-countryman, and
        Ḫammurabi his rival, one of the heroes of his time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There now remain
        to be treated of Chedorlaomer and Tidal, the remaining two of the
        four allies who fought in that memorable conflict by the Dead Sea to
        bring into subjection their revolted vassals.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the time of
        their first discovery it has been felt that the occurrence of names
        containing the element Kudur—Kudur-mabuk, Kudur-Nanḫundi,
        Kudur-Naḫḫunte, etc.—was, in itself, excellent testimony to the
        correctness of the narrative in the 14th chapter of Genesis, where an
        Elamite king having <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "he"><span style="font-style: italic">Chedor</span></span> as the
        first element of his name, attacks and conquers, in alliance with
        certain kings of Babylonia, five petty rulers of a district on the
        shores of the Dead Sea. It was, however, naturally a matter of
        disappointment that the name of Chedorlaomer himself did not occur,
        for it was soon recognized that the identification, made by Sir Henry
        Rawlinson, of Kudur-mabuk (read Kudur-mapula) with Chedorlaomer could
        not be sustained. What was wanted, was some such name as
        Kudur-Lagamar or Kudur-Lagamal, the second element having been
        recognized in other texts as the name of the Elamite deity Lagamaru.
        It was to all appearance thought to be probable that the name of
        Tidal would be found.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Accordingly, when
        two tablets were referred to at the Congress of Orientalists held at
        Geneva in 1894 as containing the names Tudḫula, Êri-Eaku (Êri-Ekua),
        and another name read doubtfully as Kudur-laḫ(gu)mal, no
        publicly-expressed objection to their possible identification with
        Tidal, Arioch, and Chedorlaomer <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page223">[pg 223]</span><a name="Pg223" id="Pg223" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> was made. The names were placed before the
        Semitic section of the Congress of Orientalists referred to, as
        recent discoveries, which were certain as far as they went, their
        identification being a matter of opinion.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">None of these
        documents are in a state of completeness, though one of them, a kind
        of poem, contains no less than 76 lines, more or less well preserved.
        The other two are of the nature, apparently, of historical legends,
        though they may be true historical documents, and, though imperfect,
        are of great importance. Concerning the names which are contained in
        these texts there is but little or no doubt, though there may be
        doubt as to the way in which they ought to be read in consequence of
        the fanciful way in which they are written.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first document
        is Sp. III. 2, and contains all three names—or, rather, the names
        Tudḫula (Tidal), Êri-Eaku's son Durmaḫ-îlāni, and Kudur-laḫmal. The
        first portion of this text refers to the gods: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Šamaš, illuminator (of the earth),”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the lord of lords, Merodach, in the faithfulness of his
        heart,”</span> aided (probably) his servant to subdue (?) some
        region, <span class="tei tei-q">“all of it.”</span> Then there is a
        reference to (soldiers) whom some ruler <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“caused to be slain,”</span> and as the name of
        Durmaḫ-îlāni son of Êri-(E)aku follows, there is every probability
        that it was he who is referred to in the preceding lines. The
        carrying off of goods (?) is next spoken of, and waters which to all
        appearance came over Babylon and the great temple-tower called
        Ê-saggil (more usually written in earlier times Ê-sagila). The next
        line has an interesting reference to <span class="tei tei-q">“the son
        (?)”</span> of some one, who <span class="tei tei-q">“slaughtered him
        like (?) a lamb with the weapon of his hands.”</span> After this, we
        are told that <span class="tei tei-q">“the elder and the child (were
        killed) with the sword.”</span> To all appearance, another division
        of the subject begins with the next line, though the text goes on
        recording things of the same nature—<span class="tei tei-q">“the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224"
        id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> child he cut off.”</span> This
        is immediately followed by the words <span class="tei tei-q">“Tudḫula
        the son of Gazza- ..,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“Tidal son
        of Gazzā(ni?),”</span> who, like Durmaḫ-îlāni (if we may form any
        opinion from the fact that the wording of the line following the
        mention of Tidal is the same as that following the name of the son of
        Êri-Eaku), carried off goods (?), and waters (he caused to flow?)
        over Babylon and Ê-saggil, the great temple of the city. The parallel
        between these two passages is still further emphasized by the words
        in the line immediately following, which says that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“his son fell upon him with the weapon of his
        hand.”</span> The next line is the last of the obverse, and speaks of
        (<span class="tei tei-q">“the proclamation,”</span> perhaps) of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“his dominion before the temple of
        Annunit,”</span> where we have the interesting archaism, <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">An-nu-nit</span></span> for D.P. (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the
        determinative prefix indicating that the name of a deity follows)
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">A-nu-nit</span></span>.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reverse begins
        with a reference to Elam, and some one (perhaps the king of that
        country) who <span class="tei tei-q">“spoiled from the city Aḫḫê (?)
        to the land of Rabbātum.”</span> Something was made, apparently by
        the same personage, into heaps of ruins, and the fortress of the land
        of Akkad, and <span class="tei tei-q">“the whole of
        Borsippa(?)”</span> are referred to. At this point comes the line
        mentioning Kudur-laḫmal, supposed to be Chedorlaomer. It reads as
        follows—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Kudur-laḫmal, his son, pierced his heart with the steel
        sword of his girdle.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this there
        is a passage where the various kings mentioned seem to be referred
        to, and it is stated that Merodach, the king of the gods, was angry
        against them, and they were, to all appearance, made to suffer for
        what they had done. The scribe who had composed this record now
        speaks, in favourable words, of the king then reigning, and seems to
        refer to the restoration of the inscription to its place by the
        person (prince) who, in later days, should find it (as was the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225"
        id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> custom among the Babylonians
        and Assyrians). He ends with a pious wish that a sinful man might not
        exist, or something to that effect.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The second tablet,
        though in a more satisfactory state of preservation, is still

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After referring to
        Babylon, and to the property of that city, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“small and great,”</span> it is said that the gods
        (apparently)</p>

        <div class="block tei tei-quote" style=
        "margin-bottom: 1.80em; margin-left: 3.60em; margin-top: 1.80em; margin-right: 3.60em">

        sovereignty in Babylon, the city of Kar-Duniaš.</span><span style=

        </div>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would therefore
        appear that this Elamite ruler, by the will of the gods (such was the
        way with conquerors in those days—they annexed other countries to
        their dominions by the will of the gods of the lands annexed), took
        possession of Babylon, capital (such seems to be the meaning of the
        phrase) of Kar-Duniaš. This is followed by a long passage in which
        animals and birds, apparently the favourites of the Elamite king, are
        referred to, and the idea which one gains by reading it is, that he
        attended to these rather than to the welfare of his realm. This being
        the case, it is natural that something about the remissness of the
        king should follow, and this seems to be, in fact, intended in the
        next line, where some one whose name is lost seems to ask:
        <span class="tei tei-q">“What king of Elam is there who has
        (erected?) the chapel (?) (it was something made of wood, as the
        determinative prefix shows) of E-saggil?”</span> It was the
        Babylonians, the text seems to say, who had done things of this kind.
        The speaker then seems to begin to talk of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“their work,”</span> when another gap destroys the
        remainder of the phrase. He then speaks about <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“(a let)ter (?) which thou hast written thus:
        <span class="tei tei-q">‘I <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg
        226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> am
        a king, the son of a king,’</span> ”</span> but whether it is the
        same personage who says that he is <span class="tei tei-q">“the son
        of the daughter of a king, who has sat on the throne of
        dominion,”</span> is doubtful—it may be a similarly boasting reply to
        the statement put into the mouth of the first speaker. The line which
        follows has the name of Durmaḫ-îlāni, son of Êri-Ekua (Êri-Eaku of
        the other historical text), who seems to have carried away spoil, but
        whether it is he who is referred to in the next line as having sat on
        the throne of dominion is doubtful. This is followed by the
        expression of the wish that the king might come who from eternal days
        ... was proclaimed lord of Babylon. The closing lines of the obverse,
        which is here described, do not give any clear sense, but there is a
        reference to the months Kislev and Tammuz, probably in connection
        with festivals, also (apparently) to certain priests, and to the
        taking of spoil. The remains of the reverse are too scanty to gather
        what the text inscribed upon it really refers to.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is naturally
        difficult to judge which of these two inscriptions came first. Both
        of them seem to have a kind of peroration at the end containing
        similar phrases referring to the city of Babylon and its well-being,
        and either might therefore be the last tablet of a series. To all
        appearance, the order of the two records turns upon the question
        whether Durmaḫ-îlāni is the one who is referred to as having written
        a certain communication, or whether it is about him that some one has
        written. As he seems to be referred to in the third person, the
        probability is that <span class="tei tei-q">“Durmaḫ-îlāni, son of
        Êri-Eaku, who (carried away?) the spoil of ... ,”</span> is not the
        person speaking, but the person spoken of. In this case he was not
        necessarily alive at the time, and the order of the two tablets as
        here printed may be the correct one.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How far the record
        which they contain may be <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg
        227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        true is with our present knowledge impossible to find out. The style
        of the writing with which they are inscribed is certainly very
        late—later, in all probability, than the Persian period, and the
        possibility that it is a compilation of that period has been already
        suggested. That it is altogether a fiction, however, is in the
        highest degree improbable. If we have in the three names which these
        two tablets contain the Babylonian prototypes of Tidal, Arioch, and
        Chedorlaomer, they must refer to the events which passed between the
        first and thirty-first years of the reign of Amraphel or Ḫammurabi,
        in which it would seem that both Durmaḫ-îlāni and Tudḫula attacked
        and spoiled Babylon, cutting the canals so that the town and the
        temple were both flooded. Both of these royal personages, who, be it
        noted, are not called kings, were apparently killed by their sons,
        and Kudur-laḫmal seems to have been a criminal of the same kind, if
        we may judge from the words <span class="tei tei-q">“Kudur-laḫmal,
        his son, pier(ced?) his heart with the steel sword of his
        girdle.”</span> That three royal personages, contemporaries, should
        all dispose of their fathers in the same way seems, however, in the
        highest degree improbable. It also seems to be in an equal degree
        impossible that (as has been suggested) the tablets in question
        should refer to Tidal, Arioch, and Chedorlaomer, but not the
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">same</span></em> Tidal, Arioch, and Chedorlaomer
        as is spoken of in Genesis, unless it be meant thereby that the
        Biblical personages of that name are the historical ones, whilst
        those of the two tablets belong to the realm of fiction. The greater
        probability is, that they are the same personages, but that the
        accounts handed down to us on these two tablets are largely
        legendary.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And that this is
        the case is made more probable by the third document, couched in

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apparently this is
        a poetical reproduction of the tablets of which translations have
        already been given. The enemy entered Babylon, according to the nine
        lines of the earlier portion of the inscription which are preserved,
        and spoiled and ravaged the place. The mention of the channel (îku,
        irrigation-channel) suggests a comparison with the first of the two
        historical fragments, where waters over Babylon and <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Ê-sagila are referred to, and cause one
        to ask whether Durmaḫ-îlāni and Tudḫula were not the lieutenants of
        Kudur-laḫgumal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The description of
        the conditions under which the entry into Babylon was effected, when
        the god (possibly Ennundagalla) was clothed with light, flashed like
        lightning and shook the holy places, suggests that a severe
        thunderstorm acted on the superstitious hopes of the Babylonians, and
        the equally superstitious fears of their foes, so much so, that the
        Elamite did not carry out his intention of carrying away the crowns
        of the statue of the god. He seems, however, to have taken and
        retained possession of the place, and to have continued to extend his
        operations.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reverse
        apparently states why all these misfortunes came, and what further
        happened. It was because they accepted a foreign ruler (he spoke
        peace to the city, and thereby became its master); because there was
        denial of righteousness or justice (righteousness was absent?);
        because the magicians repeated evil words. Even in the temple of Anu
        at Erech (the shrine called Ê-anna, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        temple of heaven,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“of Anu”</span>)
        the god of heaven was displeased, and caused something very like an
        earthquake. Some, however, were found who were willing to try to bar
        the passage of the conqueror, who had gathered the Umman-manda
        (barbarian hordes), possibly his followers and those of Tudḫula or
        Tidal, against the people (?) of Bêl (the Babylonians), and laid
        everything in ruins.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When the enclosure
        of Ê-zida (the great temple-tower of Borsippa, identified with the
        tower of Babel by modern scholars) was broken down, Ibi-Tutu,
        apparently a Babylonian prince, fled to Tiamtu, the region of the
        Persian Gulf, and there founded a temporary capital. The invader
        thereupon seems to have proceeded to Borsippa, and to have taken the
        road to Mesech—that is to say, to the north—where he continued his
        ravages. That he intended to go so <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> far as Mesech, however, is very unlikely, his
        object being to subdue the princes of the immediate neighbourhood of
        Babylon, and after collecting the spoil and goods of all the temples,
        he carried them away with him to Elam.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cyrus, when he
        entered Babylon, spoke peace to the city, and promised peace to all
        the land. In later documents even than the time of Cyrus,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the enemy, the Elamite,”</span> is spoken
        of, and there is every probability that the legend here recounted was
        popular with the Babylonians as long as any national feeling was
        left, hence these incomplete remains which have come down to us—due,
        perhaps, to some period when the old hostility was aroused by some
        inroad from the mountains on the east, where the Elamites held sway
        apparently to a comparatively late date.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether Êri-Eaku
        (or Eri-Aaku), Tudḫula, and Kudur-laḫgumal be Arioch, Tidal and
        Chedorlaomer respectively, I leave to the reader to decide for
        himself. The first of these will probably be regarded as sufficiently
        near to be exceedingly probable. With regard to the two others, it
        may be noted that Tidal was pronounced, in Hebrew, Tidghal, as the
        Greek Thargal (for Thadgal, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">d</span></em> and <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">r</span></em> being
        so much alike in Hebrew as to be easily interchanged) shows, and
        Chedorlaomer was Chedorlaghomer, as the Greek Chodollogomar likewise
        indicates. Doubt concerning the reading can only be entertained with
        regard to this last name.<a id="noteref_48" name="noteref_48" href=
        "#note_48"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever may be
        thought about the interesting and remarkable inscriptions of which an
        account has just been given, of one thing there can be no doubt, and
        that is, that the Elamites and Babylonians were quite powerful
        enough, at the time of Abraham, to make an expedition of the
        magnitude described in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page233">[pg
        233]</span><a name="Pg233" id="Pg233" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Genesis xiv. Sargon of Agadé held sway over this district, and he
        reigned, according to Nabonidus's indications, more than 1500 years
        earlier. His son, when he came to the throne, added Elam to his
        dominions as well. That the position should, at a considerably later
        period, be reversed, is easily conceivable, and it was to all
        appearance the Elamites who held sway in a part of Babylonia, of
        which country many of the states undoubtedly acknowledged Elamite
        overlordship, though with exceeding unwillingness. One point of the
        undoubted history is noteworthy. Kudur-mabuk, son of Simti-šilḫak,
        who ruled at Larsa, bears, like his father, an Elamite name. His son,
        Êri-Aku, has an Akkadian name—perhaps, as already suggested, from
        motives of policy, and likely enough from the same motive, he may
        have Semitizised it later on, making it Arad-Sin. Êri-Ekua (-Eaku) is
        likewise an Akkadian name, and must be a fanciful variant of that of
        Êri-Aku or Arioch. His son, however, bears the Semitic name of
        Durmaḫ-îlāni, <span class="tei tei-q">“the bond with the
        gods.”</span> This is apparently a case of carrying the policy of
        conciliation a step farther, for by doing this he not only bears a
        native name, but also claims to be the intermediary with the gods of
        his country.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the retreat
        of the conquering army of Elamites and Babylonians with their booty,
        with Lot, Abraham's nephew, as prisoner, and his goods as part of the
        spoil, comes the interesting account of the way in which Abraham
        rescued his relative and recovered his property, with a portion of
        that belonging to the king of Sodom. On his return with the spoil,
        Melchizedek king of Salem meets him, offering him bread and wine, and
        blessing him as Abraham of El-Elyon, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        most high god.”</span> Certain supposed confirmatory statements in
        the correspondence of Abdi-ṭâba, ruler of Jerusalem, which was found
        among the Tel-el-Amarna tablets, has been the subject of much
        discussion, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg
        234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> it
        is apparently regarded as being of much importance, though there are
        various opinions concerning it. The prince in question, when writing
        to his suzerain, the reigning king of Egypt, makes the remarkable
        statement that it was not his father nor his mother who had set him
        in that place (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Uru-salim or Jerusalem) as
        king, but <span class="tei tei-q">“the mighty king”</span>—</p>

        102.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As Abdi-ṭâba then
        goes on to emphasize his faithfulness to the king of Egypt,
        apparently on account of his having been made ruler of Jerusalem by
        him, these passages merely resolve themselves, to all appearance,
        into a statement of the writer's indebtedness to his royal master. It
        may be disappointing, but to all appearance the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“mighty king”</span> is the king of Egypt, and not the
        god of Uru-salim.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless, the
        description of Melchizedek in Heb. vii. 3, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“without father, without mother,”</span> makes it a quite
        legitimate question to ask: may not Abdi-ṭâba, in what he said to his
        suzerain, have made some mental reservation when writing what he did?
        Or is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name=
        "Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> it not possible that,
        when speaking about his independence of his father and his mother for
        the position that he occupied, he was unconsciously making use of
        words familiar to him, and recorded in some document of the archives
        of the city? We have yet to learn the history of the preceding
        period—we know not whether Abdi-ṭâba had really a right to the
        position which he occupied (he seems to have been placed as ruler of
        Jerusalem by the foreign power to which he refers), and until we get
        more information, there is no escape from the necessity of regarding
        him, from his own letters, as being in a different position from that
        which, in the fourteenth chapter of Genesis, Melchizedek
        occupies.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In connection with
        the question as to what divinity was worshipped at Jerusalem, the
        tablet known as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">B.</span></span> 105 is of importance. Line 14
        of the letter in question reads: <span class="tei tei-q">“The city of
        the land of Jerusalem, its name is Bît-Ninip, the city of the king,
        is lost—(it is) a place of the men of Kelti.”</span> What was this
        <span class="tei tei-q">“city of the king,”</span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“royal city”</span>? The general opinion at first was,
        that the place meant was Jerusalem itself, for that must have been
        from the earliest times <span class="tei tei-q">“a royal city”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">par
        excellence</span></span>. Winckler, however, translates <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">A</span></em> city of the land of
        Jerusalem,”</span> which certainly seems a reasonable rendering.
        Properly speaking, however, the idiomatic Semitic Babylonian
        expression for <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em>
        city”</span> would be <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">išten âlu</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">one</span></em> city.”</span> Though Winckler's
        rendering is a perfectly reasonable one, therefore, the first
        translation is not excluded, and in any case there remains the clear
        statement that a city of the territory of Jerusalem—that is to say a
        city which owned the sway of her kings—possessed, as its
        patron-deity, the god whom the Babylonians and Assyrians called
        Ninip, and worshipped under many names. Among these may be mentioned
        Madanunu, explained as <span class="tei tei-q">“the proclaimed (?),
        the renowned, the high”</span>; En-banda, probably meaning
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236"
        id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        distinguished lord,”</span> a name which he bore as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ninip, he who takes the decision of the gods.”</span>
        Another of his names was Ḫalḫalla, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ninip,
        protector of the decision, father of Bêl”</span>; and, more
        interesting still, he was called Me-maḫa (<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“supreme word”</span>), as <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Ninip, guardian of the supreme commands.”</span> The
        Assyrians worshipped him both under the name of Ninip and
        Apil-Êšarra, <span class="tei tei-q">“son of the house (temple) of
        the host.”</span> It is this deity whose name occurs in the Assyrian
        royal names Tukulti-Ninip and Tukulti-âpil-Ê-šarra, or
        Tiglath-pileser.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On these points,

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the matter of
        Sarai, Abraham's wife, giving her handmaid Hagar to Abraham as a
        second or inferior wife, because she had no children herself, it is
        not improbable that we have a record of what was a common custom at
        the time. On p. <a href="#Pg174" class="tei tei-ref">174</a> ff.
        translations of Babylonian tablets are given, which seem to have some
        analogies with what is stated in the Biblical narrative. In these
        inscriptions, however, the woman of inferior position, though she is
        expected to be the servant of the other, is raised, to all
        appearance, into a higher position, and described as the sister of
        the first wife, apparently by adoption, this supposition being based
        on the statement that Iltani was daughter of Sin-âbu-šu, though both
        Iltani and Taram-sagila were taken in marriage from Uttatum, their
        father. Apparently there was to be no difference in the status of the
        children of either of them, and it was apparently on account of the
        hope that Hagar's son would be as her own, that the patriarch's wife
        acted as she did.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to the
        contract at Machpelah, that is, as has already been noticed more than
        once, evidently a legal document, or at least an abstract of such a

        and Babylonia, though the latter are generally composed in much

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A comparison of
        these inscriptions, which are types of hundreds of others known to
        Assyriologists, with the transaction between Abraham and the Hittite
        Ephron, shows noteworthy differences. The boundaries are usually
        stated in the Babylonian documents with sufficiently great precision;
        but, on the other hand, the nature of the land is generally not
        stated except if it be actually under cultivation, and any trees
        growing on it are apparently mentioned only on account of their
        commercial value—when, for instance, they are fruit-bearing trees, as
        in the reference to the date-palms in the second document here
        translated. In Babylonia, as in Palestine, contracts and transactions
        of a legal nature often took place in the open space by the gate of
        the city in or near which the contracting parties lived, and where
        witnesses to the transaction could easily be found among those who
        passed in and out, or who had business in the neighbourhood. In the
        record contained in the 23rd chapter of Genesis, the names of the
        witnesses are naturally not given, but it is expressly stated that
        the contract was made <span class="tei tei-q">“in the presence of the
        children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the most
          interesting points revealed by the Tel-el-Amarna tablets, is the
          fact that the name of Jerusalem occurs, and is not called simply
          Salem (as in Gen. xiv. 18), but Uru-salim, the Aramaic (Syriac)
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Uri-shalem</span></span>, a form which
          confirms the translation given to it, namely, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“city of peace,”</span> though the writing of the word
          in the Tel-el-Amarna tablets suggests the suppression of the
          particle <span class="tei tei-q">“of,”</span> making <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the city Peace”</span> simply, which would, perhaps,
          be to a certain extent a counterpart to or an explanation of the
          form Salem, <span class="tei tei-q">“Peace,”</span> in Genesis.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no
          doubt that the name is an exceedingly interesting one. Prof. Sayce
          has suggested that there was a god named Salem, or <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Peace,”</span> and that the city was so called as
          being the abode of that deity. This, of course, is by no means
          improbable, but in no place where the name occurs—neither in the
          Tel-el-Amarna tablets nor in the historical inscriptions of
          Sennacherib—has the element <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">salim</span></span> (in Sennacherib's texts
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">salimmu</span></span>) the divine prefix
          before it. That the divine prefix should be omitted in the
          inscriptions of Sennacherib is easily understood, as the name in
          question would be a foreign one to the Assyrian scribes of his
          time. To the writers of the letters from Jerusalem, however, it was
          a native name, and one would certainly expect the name of the city,
          in such documents, to be given fully at least once.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
          that there was a god of peace among the Semites, is proved by the
          name of the Assyrian god Šulmanu or Shalman, a component part of
          the name Shalmaneser, the Assyrian Šulmanu-ašarid. It is noteworthy
          that there were no less than four Assyrian kings of this name, and
          that it means <span class="tei tei-q">“the god Shalman is
          chief.”</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Šulmanu</span></span> or <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Šalmanu
          nunu</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“Shalman the
          fish,”</span> also occurs, as the name of one <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the gods of the city Tedi, or, as
          Prof. Sayce reads it, Dimmen-Silim (better Temmena-silima), but
          this latter reading would only be the correct one if the characters
          Tedi are to be read as an Akkadian group.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is therefore
          very doubtful whether the element <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">salim</span></span> in the name of Jerusalem
          be the name of a god, notwithstanding the love that the peoples of
          the Semitic East naturally had for the blessings which the word
          implies. It formed part, as in Arabic at the present day, of many a
          greeting, and is one of the most noteworthy points of the Semitic
          languages. A poetic composition, apparently of the time of the
          dynasty of Babylon—probably contemporaneous with Abraham—seems to
          read as follows—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the
        disappearance of Abraham from the scene of his earthly wanderings, a
        prominent figure connecting Babylonia with Palestine vanishes from
        history. His son Isaac and his grandson Jacob retain, however, their
        connection with those of the family who resided at Haran, taking
        their wives from among their relatives there—Isaac because his father
        wished it, Jacob because the souls of his father and mother were
        vexed on account of the daughters of Heth whom Esau, Jacob's brother,
        had married. In this primitive story of three generations of a
        primitive family there is much to interest the student of ancient
        west Semitic manners and customs—the love of Isaac for Esau, because
        Isaac loved the savoury venison which the former provided for him;
        how Jacob, <span class="tei tei-q">“the supplanter,”</span> obtained
        his brother's birthright and the blessing which he ought to have had;
        Laban's covetousness and duplicity—all these things furnish material
        for the student of manners and customs and of human nature, but very
        little for the comparative archæologist who wishes to find
        connections between Abraham's descendants and the country which gave
        their father (or their grandfather) birth. Nevertheless there are
        points which deserve illustration.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page243">[pg 243]</span><a name="Pg243" id="Pg243" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all appearance
        the manners and customs of the families of the patriarchs had not
        changed since they came out of Babylonia. There is the same pastoral
        life, the same dislike (and probably mistrust) of strangers and
        foreigners, the same freedom on the part of the men, even the most
        honoured among them, with regard to the marriage-tie, the same
        tendency to add to this world's goods, and to become great and mighty
        chiefs in the land (would that Jacob had done this otherwise), as at
        first. The Babylonian spirit of commerce and the desire for
        <span class="tei tei-q">“supplanting”</span> was well developed in
        the father of the twelve tribes, and may be regarded as adding, as
        far as it goes, to the confirmation of the theory (but the question
        is more one of fact than of theory) that Abraham was of Babylonian
        race.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Exceedingly
        interesting are all the names borne by the patriarchs, and the
        reasons why they were given to them. Indeed, the punning references
        to circumstances concerning their birth are similar in their
        character to those of the patriarchs before the Flood. Nevertheless,
        it is noteworthy that many of the names found in this part of the
        sacred narrative are not by any means unique. Thus the name of Jacob
        occurs many times in the tablets of the period of the first dynasty
        of Babylon under the forms of <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Yakubu</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Yakubi</span></span>, etc., and there are also
        forms with the word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">îlu</span></span> attached—<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ya'kubi-îlu</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Yakub-îlu</span></span>, etc. In like wise we
        find what is apparently the same name as that of Joseph, namely,
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Yašupum</span></span> with its longer form
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Yašup-îlu</span></span>, types of many others,
        such as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Yakudum</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Yakub-îlu</span></span>, etc. As far as I have
        at present been able to find out, however, none of the names of this
        class, except <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Yakub-îlu</span></span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Yašup-îlu</span></span>, have as yet been
        discovered in both forms (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> with and without the element
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">îlu</span></span>), which may turn out to be of
        importance, or may be simply a remarkable
        coincidence.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg
        244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This, naturally,
        leads to the question: What are the meanings of these names?
        According to Genesis, Jacob means supplanter, or, rather,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“he has supplanted,”</span> and the further
        query then arises: What does the name mean when <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">îlu</span></span>
        is added to it? The meaning in this case ought to be <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“God has supplanted,”</span> which clearly will not
        fit.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The best
        explanation probably is, that the name of Jacob was never Ya´kub-ilu,
        but Ya´kub simply, meaning, <span class="tei tei-q">“he has
        supplanted,”</span> and referring, naturally, to the person who bore
        the name. As the name <span class="tei tei-q">“Supplanter”</span> is
        not one which a man would be proud to bear, in all probability it was
        seen that it would be taken for the usual abbreviation for
        Ya´kub-îlu, with the probable meaning of <span class="tei tei-q">“God
        hath restrained”</span> (another signification of the root ´aqab),
        and thus it may be that there is no record of any one having
        reproached him on account of it, except the members of his own
        family, who knew why it was given to him, and recognized in his
        character as a man something which corresponded with the name given
        to him because of what was said to have happened at his birth.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding
        the two etymologies of the name of Joseph which are given (Gen. xxx.
        23, 24), <span class="tei tei-q">“He (God) hath taken away,”</span>
        and <span class="tei tei-q">“He (God) hath added,”</span> there is
        but little doubt that the latter rendering is the correct one,
        agreeing, as it does, better with the root <span lang="he" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">yāsaph</span></span>, from which it is derived,
        the other rendering, from the root <span lang="he" class=
        "tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">āsaph</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“to
        take away,”</span> being due to a kind of pun. (The former rendering
        is explained as being from the Elohist narrative, the other from that
        of the Jehovist, but it seems not at all improbable that a woman,
        even a Canaanitess of those primitive ages, should have made a joke
        sometimes—they seem always to have been given to making strange
        comparisons with regard to words, and even the ancient Babylonians
        were not free from that failing, as at least one of the bilingual
        tablets shows.) The meaning of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page245">[pg 245]</span><a name="Pg245" id="Pg245" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> name Joseph is therefore <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He (God) hath added,”</span> corresponding with that of
        the Yašup-îlu, <span class="tei tei-q">“God hath added,”</span> of
        the tablets of the time of the dynasty of Babylon. The use of
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">š</span></em> for <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">s</span></em> must be
        due to the fact that <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Yašup-îlu</span></span> was, for the
        Babylonians, a foreign name, and that, in Assyro-Babylonian,
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">šin</span></span> was pronounced like
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">samech</span></span> and <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">samech</span></span> like <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">šin</span></span>,
        as a general rule.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the names
        of the patriarchs Jacob and Joseph, the name Sar-îli, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“prince of God,”</span> suggests a comparison with
        Israel, which is written Sir´ilâa, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Israelites,”</span> in the time of Shalmaneser II. The
        meaning attributed to this name would seem to be somewhat strained,
        as it would signify rather <span class="tei tei-q">“God hath
        striven,”</span> than <span class="tei tei-q">“he hath striven with
        God.”</span> That word-play exists also here, and that the name was a
        changed form of Sar-îli, <span class="tei tei-q">“prince of
        God,”</span> is possible, and is at least justified as a suggestion
        by the form recorded by Shalmaneser II. already referred to.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The name of his
        brother Esau may possibly exist in the Babylonian Esê, found on a
        tablet dated in the reign of Samsu-iluna. Laban does not occur,
        except as the name of a god in a list of deities worshipped in the
        city of Aššur. With regard to Bethuel, one cannot help thinking that
        it must be the same as the place-name Bethel, the terminal <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">u</span></em> of the
        nominative being retained in the name of Abraham's nephew. If this be
        the case, he may have been so named after the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Bethel of cedar”</span> (see p. <a href="#Pg201" class=
        "tei tei-ref">201</a>), though there is just the possibility that, as
        Gesenius suggests, Bethuel may be for Methuel, the Babylonian
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Mut-îli</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“man of god.”</span> That the Bethel of Haran was a
        heathen place of worship, however, can hardly be regarded as any
        objection to one of the family to which Abraham and his descendants
        belonged bearing such a name. If the Hebrew text be correct,
        therefore, it is probably an abbreviation, forming part of a name
        similar to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page246">[pg
        246]</span><a name="Pg246" id="Pg246" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Ê-sagila-zērâ-êpuš, <span class="tei tei-q">“Ê-sagila (the temple of
        Belus at Babylon) has created a name,”</span> and others like it. It
        is also to be noted, that the name given by Leah to the son which
        Zilpah her handmaid bore to Jacob after she herself left off bearing
        was Gad, rendered in the Hebrew itself by <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Fortunate,”</span> and probably the name of a west
        Semitic deity, Gad, the god of good fortune.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But the heathenism
        of the portion of the family living at or near Haran is clearly
        proved by the matter of the teraphim, which Rachel stole from her
        father Laban. It is true that they are generally regarded as figures
        used for the purpose of magic, but as Laban himself calls them his
        <span class="tei tei-q">“gods,”</span> there is every probability
        that they were worshipped as such. It is to be regarded as simply an
        indication of the difficulty which most dwellers in the midst of
        polytheism in those days must have found in dissociating themselves
        from the practices of those with whom they came daily into contact.
        They may have had all the tendencies possible towards monotheism, but
        how were they to embrace it in all its perfection in the midst of a
        population recounting from time to time the many wonderful things
        which their gods and protecting genii did for them, and which the
        hearer had no opportunity of probing to the bottom and estimating at
        their true value? As these people were, to all appearance, but simple
        shepherds (though sufficiently wealthy), it is hardly to be expected
        of them that they would go deeply into philosophical considerations
        concerning the Deity, especially when we remember that the family of
        Laban was in close contact with the idolatry of Haran.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to the
        teraphim which Rachel took with her when Jacob fled from her father,
        there is not much that can be said. Figures so called were in common
        use among the Jews and other nations for purposes of magic, and to
        all appearance they were <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page247">[pg
        247]</span><a name="Pg247" id="Pg247" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        statues of deities (as indicated in the passage now under
        consideration) which were consulted by some means when anything of
        importance was about to be undertaken. To all appearance they were
        the household gods, like the Lares and Penates of the Romans, though
        they were also used when on expeditions, as when Nebuchadnezzar is
        represented (Ezekiel xxi. 21-26 in the Heb.) standing at the parting
        of the ways to use divination, shaking arrows to and fro, consulting
        the teraphim, and looking at a liver to decide what his success in
        the operations which he was about to undertake against Jerusalem
        would be. In Zechariah x. 2 also, there is a reference to the
        teraphim, which, as oracles, had <span class="tei tei-q">“spoken
        vanity,”</span> and the diviners had <span class="tei tei-q">“seen a
        lie.”</span> Little doubt exists, therefore, as to what these things
        were used for. With regard to their form, it is supposed that they
        were similar to the small figures found in the ruins of the ancient
        palaces of Assyria, generally under the pavement, in all probability
        images of the gods of Assyria who, by their effigies, were supposed
        to protect the palace and its inhabitants. Some of these are
        four-winged figures similar to those found on the bas-reliefs, whilst
        others are representations of a deity, probably the god Êa or Aê, the
        god of the sea, who is represented clothed with a fish's skin, etc.
        The size of these teraphim must have differed greatly; that which was
        placed in David's bed by Michal, his wife, to deceive Saul's
        messengers, must necessarily have been of considerable
        height—probably not much under that of a man. Those hidden by Rachel
        when her father came to look for them, however, must have been
        comparatively small, and the figures found in the foundations of the
        Assyrian palaces rarely measure more than six inches in height.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the light of
        what this incident of the teraphim reveals, it is not to be wondered
        at that Jacob, when about to go up to Bethel from Shechem, after the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page248">[pg 248]</span><a name="Pg248"
        id="Pg248" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> treacherous spoiling of the
        city by his sons, should have said, <span class="tei tei-q">“Put away
        the strange gods that are among you,”</span> and it shows also a
        considerable amount of tolerance on the part of the patriarch. Did
        he, too, believe that the gods which his relatives and dependents
        worshipped were in any sense divine beings? In any case, it is to be
        noted that, after they were given to him, he did not destroy them,
        but hid them, with the trinkets which they possessed—in all
        probability in many cases heathen emblems—under the terebinth-tree
        which was by Shechem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all appearance
        they were allowed to keep these strange gods and heathen emblems
        until they set out on the journey to make the commanded sacrifices to
        the God who had revealed Himself to Jacob at Bethel.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was after this
        sacrifice at Bethel that God again revealed Himself as El-shaddai,
        His name in the text of <span class="tei tei-q">“the priestly
        narrator”</span> (Gen. xvii. 1), and in many other passages. The word
        Shaddai here is generally connected with the root <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">shadād</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“to act powerfully,”</span> and the translation
        <span class="tei tei-q">“God Almighty”</span> is based on this. As
        the word is a very difficult one, however, there have been many
        attempts to find a more satisfactory etymology. It is to be noted,
        therefore, that there is in Semitic Babylonian a word <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">šadû</span></span>, often applied to deities,
        and expressed, in the old language of Akkad, by means of the same
        ideograph (KURA) as is used for mountain (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">šadû</span></span>
        or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">šaddû</span></span> in Semitic Babylonian). This
        word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">šadû</span></span>, applied to divinities, Prof.
        Fried. Delitzsch regards as being distinct from the word for
        mountain, notwithstanding that they are both expressed by the same
        word in Akkadian, and renders it by the words <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“lord,”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“commander.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Have we, in this
        word, an Assyro-Babylonian form of the Hebrew Shaddai? We do not
        know, but the likeness between the two is worth referring to. The god
        Bêl, for example, is called <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">šadû
        rabû</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the great <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page249">[pg 249]</span><a name="Pg249" id="Pg249"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> mighty one,”</span> and Sin, with other
        deities, bears a similar title, found in such names as Sin-šadûnu,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Moon-god is our lord.”</span> That the
        idea of almightiness should be expressed by means of the borrowed
        Akkadian idiomatic use of the word KURA, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“mountain,”</span> as that which towers up commandingly,
        a mighty mass, would seem to offer an acceptable explanation of what
        has long been felt as a difficulty. <span class="tei tei-q">“But God
        knows best.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After a long and
        noteworthy account of Esau and his descendants, the interest of the
        narrative shifts, and is transferred to Joseph, the youngest but one
        of Jacob's twelve sons, though the narrative is for a time
        interrupted by the story of Judah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With the transfer
        of the interest of the narrative to Joseph, Egypt, the country into
        which he was sold as a slave, becomes the scene of the action. Here a
        vast and interesting store of material meets the student, which,
        unfortunately, we can only very imperfectly touch upon, partly from
        considerations of space, and partly because the present work is
        intended to be more the story of the Hebrews in connection with
        Babylonia and Assyria. It is necessary, however, to speak of Egypt
        not only on account of the continuity of the narrative, but also as
        an introduction to the chapter in which the Tel-el-Amarna tablets are
        examined—documents found in Egypt, and addressed to an Egyptian
        king.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no doubt,
        that in the story of Joseph there exists a considerable amount of
        what is known as <span class="tei tei-q">“local colour.”</span> This
        is shown by the freedom which the women of Egypt evidently enjoyed
        (as exhibited in the story of Potiphar's wife), the matter of Joseph
        shaving himself before going to see Pharaoh, the many undoubtedly
        Egyptian names, etc. These, of course, are undeniable points in
        favour of the authenticity of the narrative, which, perfect as it is,
        omits one important thing, namely, the name of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> the Pharaoh who ruled at the time. That
        there should be such an omission in the comparatively unimportant
        references to the visits of Abraham and Isaac to Egypt is, perhaps,
        not so very strange, but that there should be no clue to the identity
        of the Egyptian ruler under whom Joseph entered Egypt, nor to the
        persecutor of the Israelites under whose reign they went forth from
        what had become to them practically a hostile land, is noteworthy,
        and a matter for great regret. It is, therefore, not to be wondered
        at that scholars have arisen who doubt the whole story, for the least
        flaw in a narrative in the present day, when unbelief and the desire
        for scientific proof meet one on every hand, will cause a thinking
        man to doubt anything and everything.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The degree of
        civilization to which Egypt had attained at this period, and probably
        thousands of years earlier, is so remarkable that it is difficult for
        us at this distance of time to realize it. Whether the country was in
        reality more civilized than Babylonia is a matter of doubt—possibly
        we regard their civilization as superior on account of the monuments
        being so much better preserved, and because, in consequence of the
        nature of the climate (which is such as to preserve even perishable
        things), an untold wealth of material exists. This was not the case
        with Babylonia, in which country the annual rains have caused almost
        all woodwork to decay, and only objects of stone and clay, and much
        more rarely metal, remain, even these being in many instances more or
        less damaged and therefore defective as really useful historical
        documents.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Egyptian
        antiquities testify to the civilization of the Egyptians, as has
        already been remarked, from remote ages, and the inscriptions show
        that the kingdom was well organized, and governed by rulers whose
        sway was popular and in accordance with the wishes of the priesthood.
        This state of things lasted, according to Prof. Flinders Petrie,
        until about 2098 <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page251">[pg
        251]</span><a name="Pg251" id="Pg251" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, when suddenly this
        exceedingly conservative nation, possessing as great a dislike for
        foreigners as do the Chinese at the present time, found itself
        attacked and invaded by barbarian hordes from Western Asia. From what
        district these people came is not known. According to Josephus, they
        were regarded by some as Arabians, but Josephus himself regarded them
        as being of his own race, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Jewish. Quoting from Manetho,
        he shows that, under a ruler called Timaios, these people from the
        east, <span class="tei tei-q">“men of an ignoble race,”</span>
        invaded the land, and easily made themselves master of it without a
        battle. When the rulers of Egypt fell into their hands, they burned
        the cities, destroyed the temples of the gods, and inflicted every
        kind of indignity upon the inhabitants. At last they raised one of
        themselves named Salatis (a name evidently derived from the Semitic
        root <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">šālaṭ</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“to
        rule”</span>) to the throne. This king made Memphis his capital, both
        Upper and Lower Egypt become tributary to him, and he stationed
        garrisons in those places which were most suitable for the purpose.
        One interesting point is, that he directed his attention especially
        to the security of the eastern frontier, because he feared the
        Assyrians, who, he foresaw, would one day undertake an invasion of
        his kingdom. This, to all appearance, refers to the Babylonian
        dominion, which, as we have seen (see pp. <a href="#Pg124" class=
        "tei tei-ref">124</a> and <a href="#Pg155" class=
        "tei tei-ref">155</a>) extended to the Mediterranean. As far as our
        historical knowledge extends, his fears were groundless, as no
        serious attempt (and certainly no successful attempt) to conquer
        Egypt was made until long after the time of Salatis, when Esarhaddon,
        king of Assyria, succeeded in subjugating the country, which remained
        under Assyrian overlordship until the reign of his son
        Aššur-banî-âpli.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Salatis ruled 19
        years, and was succeeded by a king named Beon or Bnōn, who reigned 44
        years. The next ruler of this race bears the Egyptian-sounding
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page252">[pg 252]</span><a name="Pg252"
        id="Pg252" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> name of Apakhnas, and ruled
        for 37 years and 7 months. Next came Apophis, the Apepi of modern
        scholars, who occupied the throne no less than 61 years, Ianias, who
        ruled for 50 years and 1 month, having also a very long reign. After
        all these ruled Assis, 49 years and 2 months. These six, says
        Manetho, were the first of their rulers, and constantly strove to
        exterminate the Egyptians by making war upon them. Hyksos, or
        Shepherd kings, and their successors, he goes on to say, retained
        possession of Egypt 511 years.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the end the
        kings of Thebais, and of other provinces of Egypt, arose against the
        Shepherds, and a long and mighty war was carried on between them,
        until the Shepherds were overcome by a king whose name was
        Misphragmouthosis, who, having expelled them from other parts of
        Egypt, shut them up in Avaris, a tract consisting of about 10,000
        acres. All this tract the Shepherds fortified with great strength,
        whilst Thummosis, son of Misphragmouthosis, tried to force them to
        surrender by a siege, and surrounded them with an army of 480,000
        men. He was beginning to despair of being able to reduce them, when
        they agreed to capitulate, stipulating that they should be permitted
        to leave Egypt, and go with all their families whithersoever they
        pleased. This was agreed to, and they bent their way through the
        desert towards Syria. Fearing the Assyrians (Babylonians), however,
        who then had dominion over Asia, they built a city in the country
        called Judea, of sufficient size to contain them all (they numbered
        not less than 240,000), and named it Jerusalem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From this it would
        appear that, taking advantage of the disorganized state of Egypt
        about 2100 years before Christ, these Shepherd kings invaded the
        country, and gradually consolidated their power there. In process of
        time they had the whole of the country in their possession, and such
        rulers as remained <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page253">[pg
        253]</span><a name="Pg253" id="Pg253" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        were allowed to retain their provinces only as vassals, being really
        princes only in name. It is also very probable that if, as really
        appears, they were barbarians on entering Egypt, they became
        civilized by intercourse with the nation which they had conquered.
        This having been done, the monarchy which they established conformed
        more and more with that of the native Egyptian kings, so that their
        court and manner of administration were, to all intents and purposes,
        Egyptian; native administrators being appointed to many important
        posts in order to obtain the willing obedience of the people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the rule of
        these Shepherd kings began about 2100 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, and finished about
        1587 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> (Petrie), it is clear
        that the visits of Abraham, Isaac, and Joseph, including Jacob and
        his family, all fall within this period. As will easily be
        understood, such a synchronism is not without its value, especially
        when considering the historical authority of the Pentateuch. That it
        was during the dominion of the above-named rulers that Joseph entered
        Egypt is or has been the opinion of all the best students of Egyptian
        history—Birch, Brugsch, Maspero, Naville, Wiedemann, and many
        others—and there can be but little doubt of its correctness. It is
        remarkable that there is no native record of Joseph's administration,
        but this is, after all, hardly to be wondered at, especially when we
        consider the disturbed state of the country at a later date, when
        many records, especially those of the hated conquerors, must have
        been destroyed, and in any case there is the ever-present chance of
        some untoward fate overtaking them, by which such documents, if they
        really existed, may have become lost to the world for ever.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The strange thing
        about the foreign rulers who held possession of Egypt so long is, as
        has already been pointed out by Prof. Petrie, that they remained
        throughout to all intents and purposes a distinct <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> nationality. Intermarriage between the
        two races, even when they were on the most friendly terms, must have
        been comparatively rare, and it is on this account that the native
        princes succeeded at last in ridding the land of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“impure,”</span> as the native recorder has it. From this
        same record we get the information that one of the Shepherd kings was
        'Apop'i (Apepy), the Apophis of the Greeks, and that he ruled at
        Hawar, a town which is identified with Avaris. The only god which
        this ruler served was Sutekh, identified with Râ or Rê (in earlier
        times also, to all appearance, pronounced Ria), the Egyptian Sun-god.
        According to the Sallier papyrus, from which the above details are
        taken, it would seem that Râ-'Apop'i, as he is there called, sent to
        Seqnen-Rê, <span class="tei tei-q">“king of the South,”</span>
        proposing that the latter should clear away all the hippopotamuses on
        the canals of the country, in order that Râ-'Apop'i might sleep. If
        the king of the South did not succeed in doing this, then he was to
        embrace the worship of Sutekh, but if he did succeed, then Râ-'Apop'i
        promised not to bow down before any other god of Egypt except
        Amon-Râ, the king of the gods.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This, of course,
        was a distinction without a difference, and is evidently put forward
        by the writer as such, for the worship of Sutekh in all probability
        meant the renouncing of the worship of all the other gods of Egypt, a
        thing which no Egyptian was likely to consent to. On the other hand,
        the worship of Amon-Râ by the Hyksos king would have been no great
        hardship, as it would in all probability not have involved any change
        in his faith, seeing that it was generally recognized that this deity
        and Sutekh were identical.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The end of this
        story is lost, so that there is no means of finding out how matters
        were brought to a head, and the flame of revolt kindled which ended
        in the expulsion of Egypt's Semitic invaders. What the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page255">[pg 255]</span><a name="Pg255" id="Pg255"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> historical value of the fragment may be
        is uncertain, as it reads more like a romance than a true history. In
        all probability, however, its greatest importance will be found to
        lie in its local colour.<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href=
        "#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Joseph, on
        arriving in Egypt, therefore, found himself, to all intents and
        purposes, among friends. The man to whom the Ishmaelites sold him
        was, as stated in the sacred narrative, Potiphar, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“an officer of Pharaoh's, captain of the guard, an
        Egyptian.”</span> The writer of the narrative evidently wished to
        convey the idea that a man in the service of the king of Egypt, and
        bearing an Egyptian name, was not necessarily a native of the
        country. One in the favour of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page256">[pg 256]</span><a name="Pg256" id="Pg256" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Semitic ruler of the country, and enjoying his
        confidence, would naturally be favourably disposed towards a person
        of Semitic race falling into his hands, and this was actually the
        case with the Hebrew youth, who <span class="tei tei-q">“found grace
        in his sight,”</span> and became overseer of all his house. Indeed,
        it is possibly on account of this kindly disposition towards him
        (though also, and perhaps chiefly, on account of his being of the
        same race as the then ruler of Egypt), that Joseph was not at once
        put to death by his enraged master on hearing his wife's lying
        accusation against him, for no man, in those days, would have looked
        leniently upon such a crime as that with which Joseph was charged. In
        connection with this, it is noteworthy that he is said to have been
        consigned to <span class="tei tei-q">“the prison, the place where the
        king's prisoners were bound.”</span> Here, being of Semitic race, and
        helped by his God, he obtained the favour of the keeper of the
        prison, whose trusted deputy he became. Later on, after interpreting
        to the king's imprisoned chief butler his dream, he asks this
        official, when he should again be restored to his place, to make
        mention of him to Pharaoh, stating that he had been stolen away out
        of the land of the Hebrews, and had also done nothing to merit being
        detained a prisoner in that place. To all appearance he firmly
        believed that his nationality would favour him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In accordance with
        his wish, so it turned out, for after two years mention was made of
        him by the chief butler to Pharaoh, and he is careful to state that
        Joseph was <span class="tei tei-q">“an Hebrew.”</span> When called,
        by the ruler of Egypt, in accordance with the custom of the country,
        Joseph shaved himself, and put on other clothes, before entering the
        royal presence. The sympathy of the king towards him was manifested
        immediately after his interpretation of his dreams, and he was at
        once, with Oriental promptitude, made governor of all the land of
        Egypt, receiving from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page257">[pg
        257]</span><a name="Pg257" id="Pg257" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        king his ring in token of the authority conferred upon him. The
        hero's complete Egyptianizing is to all appearance terminated by his
        receiving an Egyptian name, Zaphnath-paaneah, and marrying an
        Egyptian wife, Asenath, daughter of Poti-phera, priest of On.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are a great
        many points for consideration in these few statements.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As has been
        remarked, it was doubtless due to the custom of Egyptian etiquette
        that Joseph shaved himself, setting aside his Semitic prejudices to
        the fashion, for it is supposed that Semites abhorred such a
        ceremony. Surely, it might be objected, the Semitic ruler of Egypt
        would have liked Joseph none the worse if he had retained his hair,
        and thus proclaimed his nationality, as it were, on this occasion.
        And such an objection would possess a certain amount of force. There
        is hardly any doubt, however, that Semitic abhorrence to the practice
        has been greatly exaggerated, for it was the custom for high-placed
        personages in Babylonia, in Joseph's time, to do this, and it
        remained the custom in that country until a very late date. This was,
        in all probability, a sacred duty with certain classes of people,
        such as priests and those dedicated to a divinity. A Hebrew at that
        time would probably have had no objection, therefore, to adopting the
        practice, especially in such a climate as that of Egypt, where the
        necessity of keeping as cool as possible would probably be
        recognized.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That it should be
        desired that the new viceroy should try to assimilate himself as much
        as possible with the natives of the country was probably the reason
        of Joseph's assuming an Egyptian name and taking an Egyptian wife. A
        great deal of uncertainty exists, however, as to the true Egyptian
        form and meaning of the name Zaphnath-paaneah (better
        Zaphenath-pa'eneakh). Many conjectures have been made as to its true
        Egyptian form and meaning, but that of Steindorff, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“(God), the living one, has spoken,”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page258">[pg 258]</span><a name="Pg258" id="Pg258"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is undoubtedly the best of all.<a id=
        "noteref_51" name="noteref_51" href="#note_51"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">51</span></span></a> The
        meaning generally given to the name of Asenath, his wife, is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Belonging to (the goddess) Neith,”</span>
        but a certain amount of doubt is attached to this rendering. As for
        the name of Poti-phera, her father, of that there is but little
        doubt: it is the Egyptian Pa-ti-pe-Ra', <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        gift of Ra,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“of the Sun,”</span>
        and was naturally a very appropriate name for the priest of On, or
        Heliopolis, the centre of the worship of the Sun-god. Potiphar, the
        name of the Egyptian who bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites, is
        regarded as being a shortened form of this same name.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another point, and
        that a very interesting one, is the question of the derivation of the
        word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">abrech</span></span>, which the criers were
        ordered to call out before the newly-chosen viceroy. Professor Sayce
        compares this expression, with a great amount of probability, with
        the Babylonian <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">abriqqu</span></span>, from the Akkadian
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">abrig</span></span>, the meaning which he
        attributes to it being <span class="tei tei-q">“seer.”</span> He also
        refers to another word, namely, <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">abarakku</span></span> (fem. <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">abarakkatu</span></span>). Of these two, the
        latter etymology, on account of the consonants, is the more
        preferable, though the former one would probably suit better in the
        matter of vowels. But which is the right word?—they cannot both have
        been the original of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">abrech</span></span>. The meaning of
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">abriqqu</span></span> is <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“wise one,”</span> and that of <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">abarakku</span></span> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“seer,”</span> a high official of the Assyrian (and
        probably also the Babylonian) court. The Tel-el-Amarna tablets show
        that Assyro-Babylonian literature was known and studied in Egypt, and
        this would account for the word being introduced into Egyptian. It
        must be confessed, however, that seductive though these comparisons
        may be, the forms hardly fit, otherwise nothing would seem to be more
        appropriate than that a crier should be sent to precede Joseph during
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page259">[pg 259]</span><a name="Pg259"
        id="Pg259" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> his triumphal progress through
        the streets of On or Avaris, announcing that this was the new grand
        vizier, or the great seer, who had successfully interpreted the
        king's dream. One would like to have, moreover, at least one instance
        of the occurrence of the word in Egyptian literature.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally the Jews
        of later days were very much exercised in their minds that one of the
        favourites and primitive heroes of their race should have married a
        heathen woman, daughter of the priest of the Sun at On, and legends
        seem to have been invented to account for this undesirable
        circumstance and explain it away. It is regarded as being due to this
        that there exists a Christian legend, preserved in Greek, Syriac,
        Armenian, and Latin, purporting to give the history of Asenath. She
        is represented as the proud and beautiful daughter of Pentephres
        (Poti-phera), of Heliopolis, who lived in magnificent exclusion, and
        despised all men. Her parents wished her to marry Joseph, the great
        prime minister, but this she would not do. In the course of his
        visits to collect corn, Asenath sees him, and at once falls in love
        with him. Joseph, however, will have nothing to do with her because
        she worships idols. Shutting herself up for seven days in sackcloth
        and ashes, she threw her idols out of the window, and performed a
        strict penance. An angel in the form of Joseph then visits her, and
        blesses her, giving her to eat a mystic honeycomb, signed with the
        sign of the cross. Asenath, thus accepted, arrays herself in
        beautiful garments, and goes forth to meet Joseph. He had returned to
        the house in her parents' absence, but notwithstanding this, the
        betrothal at once takes place, and afterwards their marriage in the
        Pharaoh's presence. Her subsequent adventures include an attempt to
        carry her off on the part of Pharaoh's first-born, aided by Dan and
        Gad, and in this attempt the heir to the throne loses his life. The
        original legend made Asenath a Jewess by birth. (See Smith's
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Dictionary</span> <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        Biography</span></span>, and Hastings's <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dictionary of the
        Bible</span></span>, sub voc.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To what has
        already been said about the points tending to show that Joseph was
        viceroy in Egypt under one or more of the Hyksos or Shepherd kings,
        may be added the fact that, when his father and brethren came to
        settle in the land, they were instructed to say that they were
        shepherds, though it is at once added that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“shepherds were an abomination to the Egyptians.”</span>
        The only thing, to all appearance, that can be argued from this is,
        that however the native Egyptians might be inclined to look upon the
        new-comers, the ruler of the land (who is also represented as being
        pleased that Joseph's brethren had come) had no objection to them on
        that account. In support of the contention that the period of Joseph
        was the Hyksos period, it must also be pointed out that this new
        viceroy introduced at least one measure which might be regarded as
        somewhat harsh. He appropriated the surplus produce of the seven
        years of plenty, and when the years of famine came, he compelled the
        Egyptians to buy back, <span class="tei tei-q">“even to their own
        impoverishment,”</span><a id="noteref_52" name="noteref_52" href=
        "#note_52"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">52</span></span></a> what
        they had themselves previously parted with for nothing. The reason
        for this, however, seems to be clear. The Pharaoh upon the throne was
        of the same race as himself, and he and all Semitic foreigners in the
        land, including his father and brethren, were dependent on the same
        state of things continuing. What he then did would have the effect of
        placing the native Egyptians still more in the power of their ruler,
        consolidating the dynasty of Semites to which he belonged, and going
        far, therefore, to ensure the permanency of its rule. In acting as he
        did, Joseph was only doing what any other man in his position and of
        his race would have done.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As has been
        frequently pointed out, famines occurred from time to time in Egypt,
        and records <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg
        261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        them are in existence. Even before the time of the Hyksos kings, a
        failure of the waters of the Nile to rise to their ordinary height
        would bring great want and distress. At such times the governors of
        the various provinces of the kingdom gloried, as Ebers says, in
        helping their subjects, and saving them from distress. Thus Ameni or
        Amen-em-ha, whose tomb is at Benihasan, praises himself in the
        following words—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I cultivated the entire nome of Maḫ with many
        workpeople, I troubled no child and oppressed no widow, neither did I
        keep a fisherman from his fishing, or a herdsman from his herd. There
        was no head of the village whose people I had taken away for
        compulsory labour, and there was no one unhappy in my days or hungry
        in my time. When, however, a famine arose, I tilled all the fields in
        the nome of Maḫ, from its southern to its northern boundary, and gave
        nourishment and life to its inhabitants. So there was no one in the
        nome who died of hunger. To the widow I allowed as much as to the
        wife of a man, and in all that I did I never preferred the great man
        to the small one. When the Nile rose again, and everything
        flourished—fields, trees, and all else—I cut off nothing from the
        fields.”</span>—Ebers in Bædeker's <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Upper
        Egypt</span></span>, 1892, p. 15.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amen-em-ha
        departed this life in the 43rd year of Usertesen I., or about 2714
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">More interesting
        still, however, is the famine which occurred in the time of Baba, or
        Beby, as his name is also written. This functionary actually lived
        during the period of the dominion of the later Hyksos kings, and
        therefore very close to the time of Joseph. According to Brugsch,
        Baba lived and worked under the native king Ra-seqenen or Seqenen-Rê
        III., at the city now represented by the ruins of El-Kâb. Though the
        famine of which he speaks lasted <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page262">[pg 262]</span><a name="Pg262" id="Pg262" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class="tei tei-q">“many years,”</span>
        and notwithstanding that the ruler whom he served was a contemporary
        of 'Apop'i, the Apophis of Josephus, in whose reign, according to
        this Jewish historian, Joseph lived, it is thought that there is no
        reason to regard the calamity here referred to as being the famine of
        which so full an account is given in Genesis—such a supposition is
        <span class="tei tei-q">“entirely gratuitous,”</span> according to
        the writer in Bædeker's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Upper Egypt</span></span>. However this may be,
        there is no doubt that it is a very important parallel, and would
        imply that two disastrous famines took place in Egypt in close
        succession.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following is
        Brugsch's translation of this text—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The chief of the table of princes, Baba, the risen
        again, speaks thus: <span class="tei tei-q">‘I loved my father, I
        honoured my mother; my brother and my sisters loved me. I stepped out
        of the door of my house with a benevolent heart; I stood there with
        refreshing hand, and splendid were the preparations of what I
        collected for the feast-day. Mild was my heart, free from noisy
        angers. The god bestowed upon me a rich fortune on earth. The city
        wished me health and a life full of freshness. I punished the
        evildoers. The children who stood opposite me in the town during the
        days which I have fulfilled were, small as well as great, 60; there
        were prepared for them as many beds, chairs (?) as many, tables (?)
        as many. They all consumed 120 ephas of durra, the milk of three
        cows, 52 goats, and nine she-asses, of balsam a hin, and of oil two
        jars.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘My speech may appear a joke to
        some opponent. But I call as witness the god Month that my speech is
        true. I had all this prepared in my house; in addition I gave cream
        in the pantry and beer in the cellar in a more than sufficient number
        of hin measures.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“ <span class="tei tei-q">‘I collected the harvest, a

        "Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> when a famine arose,
        lasting many years, I issued corn to the city at each

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As, in Hebrew,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“seven”</span> is often a round number,
        equivalent to the English <span class="tei tei-q">“several,”</span>
        the parallel is noteworthy. An additional remark upon the subject of
        the Pharaoh of Joseph by Ebers (Smith's <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dict. of the
        Bible</span></span>, vol. i. pt. ii. p. 1729) is sufficiently
        striking. He says that the Byzantine chronographer who is known under
        the name of Syncelles (he held the office of Syncellus or suffragan
        in his monastery), like Josephus and others, calls the Pharaoh of
        Joseph Apophis. Now Arab tradition, <span class="tei tei-q">“in which
        little or no reliance can be placed,”</span> says that he was an
        Amalekite of the name of Raian ibn el-Walid, and Naville, when
        excavating for the Egypt Exploration Fund, at Bubastis, found a block
        with the name of Apophis, and near it the lower part of a statue of
        black granite with the name of Ian-Ra or Ra-ian, in hieroglyphics. In
        consequence of this, Dr. Rieu and Mr. Cope Whithouse maintain that
        this Arab tradition was founded on fact. <span class="tei tei-q">“We
        must therefore leave it uncertain,”</span> adds Prof. Ebers,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“whether Joseph came down into Egypt in the
        reign of Apophis, or in the reign of the hitherto unknown
        Raian.”</span> Perhaps both are right, and Joseph was in Egypt during
        the reigns of two or more Egyptian kings. Traditions are sometimes
        strangely correct, in certain points, though grossly untrustworthy in
        others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Ebers's article
        to which reference has already been made, the writer is of opinion
        that Joseph met the king of Egypt on the occasion of the
        interpretation of the latter's dream, either at Tanis, the Zoan of
        the English translation (better Ṣo'an), the Arab. Ṣân, borrowed to
        all appearance from the Coptic Dzhane (Dzhani, Dzhaane, Dzhaani),
        from the Egyptian Dzha'an, or at Bubastis, the Egyptian Pi-Bast, the
        Pi-Beseth of Ezekiel xxx. 17, or at Memphis, the Egyptian
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264"
        id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Men-nofr, the Biblical Moph or
        Noph. Of these three sites the first (Tanis) is considered the most
        probable. It is situated at the north-east of the Delta, and was
        founded, according to Numbers xiii. 22, seven years after Hebron.
        From this statement, one would think that there must be some
        connection between these two places, or else some historical fact is
        to be associated with it. One thing is certain, and that is, that
        Tanis was the residence of the Hyksos kings, who held court there for
        a considerable period, as did also many who preceded and followed
        them. The ruins are extensive, and the place is noted for its Hyksos
        sphinxes, in whose faces <span class="tei tei-q">“the coarse Hyksos
        type”</span> is strongly marked. The officers under the Pharaoh of
        the Exodus speak, in their letters, of the life there as being sweet,
        and praise the neighbourhood for its fertility and the abundance of
        the food it produced (Ebers).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
        Bubastis (the modern Tel-Basta) may have been the place where Joseph
        saw Pharaoh for the first time, as it was a place of great
        importance, and had a celebrated temple dedicated to the goddess
        Bast. Memphis, too, may be regarded as having claims, on account of
        its being situated so near to On, the abode of Joseph's
        father-in-law.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On, where
        Potiphera (<span class="tei tei-q">“dedicated to the Sun”</span>) was
        priest, was the celebrated city of the Sun-god in Egypt, whose
        foundation went back to an exceedingly remote antiquity. Besides Râ,
        Tum or Tmu (the evening sun), Râ-Harmachis (the morning sun), his
        companion Thoth, Sehu and Tefnut, children of Tum, and Osiris, who
        was venerated there as the soul of Râ, were among the deities of the
        place. To these must be added Horus, son of Osiris and Isis, god of
        the upper world or region of light. His mother Isis was worshipped at
        On under the name of Isis-Hathor, corresponding with Venus Urania.
        Besides these deities, various animals were held in honour, among
        them <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page265">[pg 265]</span><a name=
        "Pg265" id="Pg265" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> being two lions,
        perhaps representing Sehu and Tefnut, who were worshipped under the
        form of these animals; the bull Mnevis, sacred to Râ or Rê; and the
        Phœnix, called by the Egyptians <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Bennu</span></span>, the bird of Râ, which was
        supposed to bring the ashes of its father to On once every 500 years,
        after the latter had been consumed by fire. Other sacred animals in
        this city were cats and a white sow. No wonder the Israelites of old
        winced at the thought that their hero Joseph, so perfect in
        character, wedded the daughter of a priest of this idolatrous
        city.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The shrine here
        was immensely wealthy. The staff of priests, officials, and
        subordinates connected with the temple is said to have numbered no
        less than 12,913. As the embodiment of the god Râ on earth, the king
        of the land naturally gave this shrine predominance, and increased
        its wealth by his gifts. This, added to the fact that the place had
        the honour of giving him a title (<span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of
        On”</span>) of which he, in his turn, was naturally proud, added
        greatly to the renown of the city. Besides the great temples, it is
        said to have been also <span class="tei tei-q">“full of
        obelisks,”</span> which were dedicated to the Sun-god in consequence
        of their being emblematic of his rays. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Cleopatra's Needle”</span> on the Embankment, the
        obelisk bearing the same name at Cairo, the Flaminian obelisk at
        Rome, and probably many others, all came from this city. According to
        Herodotus, the priests of Heliopolis or On were renowned above all
        others in Egypt for learning.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hyksos who
        held rule in Egypt for so many centuries are regarded as having been
        wandering hordes of Bedouin Asiatics, called by the Egyptians

        of them under their name of Amu, regarded as being a word derived
        from the Semitic 'Am, from the root <span class=

        not exactly known, but Petrie's estimate, 2097 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, may be taken as the
        nearest at present possible. In <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page266">[pg 266]</span><a name="Pg266" id="Pg266" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> connection with this it may be noted that, at
        the modern fishing-village of Sân, the present representative of the
        ancient Tanis, which was the city of the Hyksos kings described
        above, the faces and figures of the inhabitants are strange and
        unlike those of the remainder of Egypt. They call themselves
        Melakiyin, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Melekites or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Royalists,”</span> a name applied in the Christian
        period to a sect of the orthodox Church. They were anciently known as
        Pi-shemer, corrupted to Bashmurites, and also as Pi-Amu, corrupted to
        Biamites. There is, therefore, hardly any doubt that these people,
        the descendants of the wild and turbulent Bashmurites and Biamites
        who gave so much trouble to the khalifs Merwân II. (744-750) and
        Mamun (813-822), may claim for their ancestors either such of the
        followers of the Hyksos kings who, on the expulsion of the latter,
        decided to remain in the country, or else of those Semites whom the
        Hyksos found in Egypt when they conquered the country, and who helped
        them to consolidate their dominion, partly from sympathy and partly
        from interest.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding
        Joseph's long residence in Egypt, it is noteworthy that, like the
        Hyksos rulers of the land, he did not, to all appearance, become in
        any sense Egyptianized, but retained his Semitic nationality to the
        last, as is shown by his command to his Hebrew fellow-subjects to
        carry his remains away with them when they, in the fulness of time,
        should leave the country. This being the case, Kalisch has asked,
        very naturally, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why did not Joseph, like
        Jacob, order his body to be conveyed at once to Canaan?”</span> In
        all probability the explanation is, that the Apophis referred to by
        the Greek writers was, as has been suggested, a contemporary of
        Seqnen-Rê III., and therefore quite close to the end of the Hyksos
        period. Joseph must, then, have passed at least part of his life
        under native Egyptian rule, and at this time national <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page267">[pg 267]</span><a name="Pg267" id="Pg267"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> feeling must have been more violently
        anti-Semitic than ever. It may therefore be supposed that it would
        not have been by any means politic for him to proclaim his
        nationality in this way, for this might have the effect of
        endangering the lives and prospects of his surviving countrymen, who
        were all related to him, by attracting to them the attention of the
        hostile populace and court—a thing which would, and did, happen soon
        enough.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A still more
        difficult question to answer would be, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why
        did not the Hebrews go out of Egypt with the Hyksos?”</span> The
        answer probably is, that Joseph was, to all appearance, still known
        and honoured by the native Pharaoh, when he came to the throne, for
        what he had done for the country. It was seemingly not until after
        Joseph's death that a Pharaoh arose who knew him not. It may
        therefore be supposed that, until that time, the Hebrews lived
        unmolested in the land which they had so long made their home.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such are the words
        which the new king who knew not Joseph, when he came to the throne,
        spoke to his people with regard to the alien population which had
        been allowed during a former reign to settle in the land of Goshen, a
        fruitful district on the north-east of Egypt, east of Bubastis
        (Zakāzik). It is the speech of one who feared that, if nothing were
        done to prevent them from becoming too powerful, they would be a
        source of danger to the state, as they might join, with every chance
        of success, in any attack which might be made on the kingdom over
        which he ruled. It was, in all probability, the presence of a similar
        foreign (Semitic) population in or near this district, about 2100
        years <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, which had
        contributed—or perhaps even made—the success of the Hyksos invaders,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page269">[pg 269]</span><a name="Pg269"
        id="Pg269" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> through which Egypt had been
        ruled by an alien dynasty for five hundred years. The repetition of
        such a catastrophe was at all hazards to be prevented. It would seem,
        therefore, that the persecution of the Hebrews was not undertaken
        altogether wantonly, but with the object of turning aside a possible
        misfortune.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the historical
        nature of the Exodus has not as yet been absolutely disproved, it is
        here taken to be a matter of history, and this being the case, it is
        necessary to try to identify, or, rather, to state what are the most
        probable opinions, as to the rulers of Egypt at the time of the
        Oppression and the Exodus. Ramses II. of the nineteenth dynasty is
        generally held to be the Pharaoh of the Oppression, and Meneptah, his
        son and successor, the Pharaoh of the Exodus. Lieblein, however,
        would regard this latter event as having occurred during the reign
        either of Amenophis III., or his son, Amenophis IV., of the
        eighteenth dynasty. This latter theory is based on the Tel-el-Amarna
        letters, which speak of the Ḫabiri, roving bodies of men which went
        about Palestine stirring up the people, and even compelling them by
        force to renounce Egyptian rule (which extended in those days over
        the whole of this district). It will be part of the scope of the
        present work to examine into this question.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the death of
        Seqnen-Rê in battle (see p. <a href="#Pg255" class=
        "tei tei-ref">255</a>), he was buried in the usual way at Thebes,
        implying, as Petrie points out, that the Egyptians had pushed their
        frontier some way to the north, <span class="tei tei-q">“so that
        ceremonials at Thebes were uninterrupted.”</span> Further advance, he
        thinks, was made in the reign of Kames, <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        valiant prince,”</span> as he calls himself, because Aah-mes was able
        to besiege the stronghold of the Hyksos down in the Delta at the
        beginning of his reign, about 1585 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> It is to be noted that
        two names come, to all appearance, between those of <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page270">[pg 270]</span><a name="Pg270" id="Pg270"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Kames and Aah-mes, but these are probably
        not those of important kings, though a part of the honour of the
        progress made ought to be accredited to them. To all appearance it
        was the efforts of the Thebans, who had been pushing their way
        northwards during these last three years, which prepared the way for
        the successes of Aah-mes—successes which placed him on the throne of
        Egypt, thus making him the founder of the eighteenth dynasty.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Before he became
        Pharaoh, he succeeded, within four or five years, not only in getting
        rid of the overlordship of the Hyksos kings, but also in driving them
        out of the Nile valley, taking possession of Avaris, and pursuing
        them into Palestine. Here, in the fifth year, he was able to capture
        Sharhana or Sharuhen, some miles south of Lachish. He then went on to
        Zahi (Phœnicia), and later defeated the Mentiu of Setet (the Bedouin
        of the hill-country), attacking afterwards the Anu Khenti. On his
        return to Egypt, he found that he had to deal with two outbreaks on
        the part of those of the Hyksos (probably half-breeds) who remained,
        and these having been reduced to subjection, there was apparently no
        further trouble from the Asiatics remaining in the country. So
        popular was this founder of a new dynasty in Egypt, that both he and
        his queen had divine honours paid to them beyond those rendered to
        any other Egyptian ruler. His son Amen-hotep I. shared largely in
        these testimonies of popular esteem.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this the
        power of Egypt increased. The venerable captain of marines, Aah-mes,
        relates that 'Aa-kheper-ka-Rê (Thothmes I.) went against the Rutennu
        (Syrians) for the purpose of taking satisfaction, and marched as far
        as Naharaina (Upper Mesopotamia), where he found that an enemy had
        plotted conspiracy. On this occasion Thothmes gained many victories
        and took many captives. Another official mentioning the Syrian
        campaigns of this ruler is Pen-nekheb, who <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> accompanied him to Naharaina. Thothmes III.
        also refers to his grandfather's conquest in Syria, stating that he
        placed another inscription where the tablet of his father
        'Aa-kheper-ka-Rê was, and adds that <span class="tei tei-q">“his
        majesty came to the city of Niy on his return. Then his majesty set
        up his tablet in Naharaina to enlarge the frontiers of Kemi,”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Egypt. Niy was in the region
        of Aleppo, on the Euphrates.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thothmes II.
        (1516-1503, Petrie) retained those portions of Syria which his father
        had conquered. An expedition thither is also mentioned by Pen-nekheb,
        who says: <span class="tei tei-q">“I followed the king
        'A-kheper-en-Rê (Thothmes II.), the blessed one. I brought away from
        the land of the Shasu (Bedouin, apparently the same tribes as those
        to which the Hyksos or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">hak shasu</span></span> belonged) very many
        prisoners—I cannot reckon them.... The king 'A-kheper-en-Rê gave me
        two gold bracelets, six collars, three bracelets of lapis-lazuli, and
        a silver war-ax.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thothmes III.
        (1505-1449), son of Thothmes II., had one of the longest and most
        glorious reigns in all Egyptian history. He was born at Thebes, and
        crowned when about nine years old. On the death of Hatshepsut, the
        queen regent, his father's first wife, who, however, was not his own
        mother, his warlike expeditions began, and he assembled an army on
        the frontier of Zalu, preparatory to an expedition against the chiefs
        of Southern Syria, who had rebelled. This was his twenty-second year.
        Next year, on his coronation-day, he found himself, after a long
        march, at Gaza, on the way to Carmel and Megiddo, where he defeated
        the assembled Syrian chiefs, and utterly routed them on the plain of
        Esdraelon. The allies then took refuge in the town, which was
        besieged, and they were obliged to capitulate. Enormous spoils from
        this place, as well as from the other cities of Syria, was the
        result. This expedition was repeated in the two following
        years.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg
        272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In his
        twenty-ninth year he made his fifth expedition to the Syrian
        hill-country, Tunep, Arvad, and Phœnicia, from which latter district
        much spoil was obtained. The two following years found him in the
        same region. In his thirty-third year he set up a tablet on the
        boundaries of Naharaina. The next year he made a campaign to, and
        received tribute from Syria, Phœnicia, and Cyprus. In his
        thirty-fifth year he went to Phœnicia, and received tribute from
        Naharaina. The year following this he received tribute from Cyprus.
        After this he again went to Phœnicia, and he is supposed to have
        received tribute from Cyprus, Syria, and the Hittites in the fortieth
        and forty-first years of his reign. In his forty-second year there
        was an expedition to Tunep, Kadesh, etc. Besides the above, he either
        made himself, or dispatched, under his generals, during his long
        reign (fifty-four years) many expeditions into other lands than those
        mentioned above, and also took part in numerous works and public
        functions in his own country.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The expeditions in
        Syria made by this king are told very graphically and at great
        length. The march to Megiddo, the council of war, and the
        dispositions for the attack, are given in full, and the king claims
        to have himself protected his army when going through a narrow defile
        in which all might have been lost had the enemy against whom they
        were marching made an onslaught. Representations of the spoil taken
        accompany the lists enumerating the amount, and show that the ancient
        Syrians had attained to a skill, in the arts as then known, equal, if
        not superior, to that of the Egyptians. Among the places mentioned
        are Arvad, Kadesh, Gaza, Yemma, etc. Besides Thothmes III.'s own
        annals, there is an inscription of one of his officers, Amen-em-heb,
        who gives his version, which, however, is not divided into different
        years. This text mentions the Negeb, where he took some captives;
        Carchemish, from which place he obtained <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> spoil, and other places. He speaks also of
        Thothmes III. having hunted elephants in the land of Niy, one hundred
        and twenty in number, for their tusks. This agrees with what has been
        stated from the Assyrian inscriptions (pp. <a href="#Pg200" class=
        "tei tei-ref">200</a>, <a href="#Pg201" class="tei tei-ref">201</a>)
        concerning the existence of these animals in the Lebanon and around
        Haran.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thothmes III. was
        succeeded by Amenophis II., a warlike and vigorous ruler, who
        followed in his father's footsteps, and by so doing maintained the
        power and influence of his country. Petrie (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">History</span></span>,
        ii. p. 154) argues with great probability that he was not of age when
        he came to the throne, and that he was apparently not the eldest of
        his father's sons. His first expedition, which was a raid in Asia
        <span class="tei tei-q">“to establish his renown,”</span> was
        probably, as Prof. Petrie says, in the first or second year of his
        reign. <span class="tei tei-q">“His majesty had success (in
        Shemesh-atuma of South Galilee), his majesty himself made captives
        there.... Account of what his majesty himself took in this day:
        living prisoners Satiu 18, oxen 19.”</span> Later on he had some
        further success, and took spoil from the Satiu with whom he
        fought.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In his second
        year, six months after the above expedition, he seems to have made a
        promenade in force as far as the frontiers of the Egyptian domains in
        Asia, in order to assert his power, and as a check to any
        disaffection which might exist. After this there was a triumphal
        return to Egypt, where he held a festival on the occasion of the
        laying of the foundation-stone of the temple of Amadeh. Among the
        captives sent to Egypt were seven chiefs of the territory of Takhsi,
        near Aleppo, who were hung up by the feet on the fore-part of the
        king's barque. Of these six were afterwards hung up on the wall of
        Thebes in the same manner, a circumstance which suggests that the
        Egyptians were upon about the same level as the Assyrians with regard
        to their barbarous customs in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> war, notwithstanding their civilization and
        polish in other things.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He claims as his
        own nearly all the lands which his father had conquered—the South
        land, the Oases, the Lybians, Nubians, Semites, Kefto (according to
        W. Max Müller, Cilicia), and the Upper Rutennu, or district of
        Megiddo.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Amenophis II. died
        in 1423 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, and was succeeded by
        his son, Thothmes IV. His earlier years seem to have been occupied in
        asserting his power in Syria, and his later years were devoted to
        Nubia. Naharaina and the Kheta or Hittites occur in inscriptions
        referring to the former period. According to Manetho, he reigned nine
        years and eight months. He was succeeded by his son, Amenophis III.
        (1414-1379, according to Petrie).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this time Syria
        was completely in the hands of the Egyptians. Constant intercourse
        went on between the princes of the two countries, who in Syria seem
        to have been contented with their subordinate position. It is during
        this reign that the now celebrated Tel-el-Amarna tablets come to our
        aid, and show how this was brought about. Alliance between the two
        countries by marriage had taken place, and the royal and various
        princely families were therefore related. Besides this, there was
        naturally reluctance on the part of a prince of Syria to take up a
        hostile attitude with regard to the king who had taken his daughter
        in marriage, as he would always be in fear of endangering his
        daughter's safety, and for the same cause he would naturally try to
        restrain the petty rulers of his own district, including those of his
        neighbours who were more of the nature of equals. In addition to
        this, the sons of the Syrian chiefs were sent to be educated in
        Egypt, and as the Egyptian ruler at the time had married Syrian
        princesses, it is probable, as Petrie says, that the sons of Syrian
        chiefs, educated in Egypt, were married to Egyptians at the close of
        their <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name=
        "Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> education. As it was
        only stipulated that they should be restored to their native country
        to succeed their fathers, they may, it is thought, have lived in
        Egypt until middle life. This being so, the rulers of Syria would
        naturally become imbued with the thoughts and ways of the Egyptians,
        and undesirous, therefore, of throwing off the yoke. If, however,
        things were all really as thus depicted, there is one thing which is
        strange, namely, that the correspondence which was carried on between
        the two districts was not in Egyptian (which the princes of Syria
        ought to have known sufficiently well to write), but in
        Assyro-Babylonian, which was a foreign tongue to them all, especially
        the king of Mitanni, whose native language was not even Semitic. That
        the kings of Babylonia should correspond with the king of Egypt in
        Babylonian was to be expected, but if the kings of Syria, or their
        sons, were educated in Egypt, it is remarkable that we find so many
        letters in the Babylonian language.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apparently,
        therefore, everything pointed to a continuance of the state of things
        which existed at the time of the king's accession to the throne. It
        was evidently his desire that nothing should occur to change the
        cordial relations which existed between himself and the Egyptian
        dependencies, hence the mild suzerainty exercised. There was an
        Ethiopian campaign in his fifth year, after which, to all appearance,
        no warlike expeditions were undertaken—in fact, it was considered
        that there was no need for them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The first wife of
        Amenophis III. was Teie, as the Tel-el-Amarna tablets call her, the
        Teyi of the Egyptian monuments. She was daughter of Yewea and Tewa,
        and was to all appearance of Asiatic nationality. Prof. Petrie thinks
        that she may have been of Syrian race, and as a matter of fact, her
        portrait shows her with a pleasant face of Semitic type and a pointed
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276"
        id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> chin. To all appearance, she
        was a personage of great importance in the land, and when
        negotiations with the princes of the north were being carried on, she
        was one of those who were taken into consideration by the
        outlanders.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In one of the
        tablets from Tel-el-Amarna, it would appear that, besides Teie,
        Amenophis III. had married a sister of Dušratta, king of Mitanni,
        named Gilu-ḫêpa, for news of whom Dušratta wrote to the Pharaoh,
        sending presents to him, as well as to his sister. Later on, the
        Egyptian king asks Dušratta for one of his daughters, sending a
        messenger named Manê with a tablet to that effect. As Dušratta in his
        letter to the Pharaoh Nimmuaria (Neb-mut-Ra,<a id="noteref_54" name=
        "noteref_54" href="#note_54"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">54</span></span></a>
        Amenophis III.) refers to her as the (future) mistress of Egypt, it
        is clear that she was intended as the consort of his son, Amenophis
        IV. From other letters which passed between them, it would seem that
        the princess in question was named Tâdu-ḫêpa, called, in Egyptian,
        Nefer-titi (perhaps a translation of her Mitannian name). It was to
        all appearance the custom in those days, as at the present time, for
        the kings of the various states to ally themselves by marriage with
        other royal houses; and at a time when kings, at least, were allowed
        more wives than one, it was possible for them to take pledges for the
        preservation of peace by making use of the privilege. Quite in
        accordance with this are the statements contained in other texts
        concerning intermarriages of this kind, both Amenophis III. and IV.
        having likewise espoused Babylonian princesses, daughters of
        Kallima-Sin and Burra-buriaš, the son of the latter being at the same
        time betrothed to Amenophis IV.'s daughter. They were also constantly
        making presents to each other, each trying to get as much as he
        possibly could of the things which were <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> not common in his own land—gold, much gold,
        being the commodity that the king of Egypt was expected to supply.
        The other kings sent him, in return, various stones (lapis-lazuli
        being often mentioned), chariots, horses, and other things, both
        natural and manufactured products. The women by whose means these
        friendly relations had been established, made use of the messengers
        sent to their fatherland to transmit messages to their relatives and
        ask after their health.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From these tablets
        we obtain certain details as to the state of the Holy Land and the
        surrounding country before the entry of the Israelites. Besides the
        kingdom of Mitanni mentioned above, there were the states of Alašia
        (supposed to be Cyprus), Ziri-bašani (plain of Bashan), Hazor,
        Askelon, Lachish, Gaza, Qatna (west of Damascus), Accho, Simyra,
        Tyre, Sidon, the Amorites, the Hittites, Dunip (Tenneb), Jerusalem,
        etc., etc. Many of them were small states with the cities after which
        they are named as capital, and naturally were obliged to enter into a
        league for their common protection, or else accept the suzerainty of
        some more powerful state, falling, if its protector went under, into
        the power of the common invader. It must have been in consequence of
        this state of things in the east Mediterranean littoral that Egypt
        was able to extend her power so far, and subdue this large
        district.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From these tablets
        we learn something of their religion. To all appearance one of the
        gods most worshipped in the extreme west of Asia was Rimmon, the
        Rammānu (<span class="tei tei-q">“thunderer”</span>) of the Assyrians
        and Babylonians, the Addu or Hadad of the Semitic nations of this
        district (the name Addu afterwards became general as the appellation
        of the god in Babylonia and Assyria), and the Tešupa or Tešub of
        Mitanni (Aram-Naharaim) and district to the north (Armenia). At Tyre
        they seem to have worshipped <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page278">[pg 278]</span><a name="Pg278" id="Pg278" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> a personage or deity called Šalmayātu, whilst
        the Phœnician Astarte is commemorated in âl Aštarti, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the city of Aštartu,”</span> perhaps Ashtaroth, 29 miles
        east of Tiberias (Petrie). As the word Ashtoreth is evidently a
        lengthening of the name of the Assyro-Babylonian goddess Ištar, it is
        not to be wondered at that this goddess should be mentioned by the
        king of Mitanni, Dušratta, who refers to a statue of Ištar of
        Nineveh, which had been sent to Egypt, and requests that it may be
        returned to him soon. The name of Nergal, also, was evidently
        familiar to the king of Alašia, for he speaks of the hand of that god
        as having killed all his people, when wishing to refer to the
        prevalence of a pestilence there, Nergal being the Assyro-Babylonian
        god of disease and death. In the same way Dušratta speaks of Šamaš,
        the Assyro-Babylonian Sun-god, but he refers to him more as the
        luminary which men love than as a god, though there is every
        probability that he was worshipped in Mitanni.<a id="noteref_55"
        name="noteref_55" href="#note_55"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">55</span></span></a> Another
        Assyro-Babylonian deity whose name occurs is Ninip, once in the name
        of Abdi-Ninip, <span class="tei tei-q">“servant of Ninip,”</span>
        apparently a Gebalite, and again in <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">âl
        Bêth-Ninip</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“(city of) the
        temple of Ninip,”</span> in a district which Abdi-Aširta called upon
        to unite against Gebal—perhaps the Beth-Ninip in the neighbourhood of
        Jerusalem. In the name of Abdi-Aširta it is to be noted that we have
        here, to all appearance, the name of the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">asherah</span></span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“grove”</span> of the Authorised Version, the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“token”</span> of the goddess Ištar,<a id=
        "noteref_56" name="noteref_56" href="#note_56"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">56</span></span></a> with the
        ideogram for which the word once interchanges. The Egyptian god Amāna
        (Amon) is mentioned several times, invoked apparently as a god in
        whom the writer believed, though he was the special god of the
        Egyptians and the Egyptian king. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page279">[pg 279]</span><a name="Pg279" id="Pg279" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> In addition to the above deities, the names of
        men reveal Uraš, the god of Dailem near Babylon, Bidina, another
        Babylonian deity, and Merodach, the principal god of the Babylonians.
        Among west Semitic deities may be mentioned Dagan (Dagon), Milku
        (Melech, Moloch), and others.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding a
        considerable period of Egyptian rule, therefore, Babylonian
        influence, which had been predominant in the tract for many
        centuries, still held the upper hand. Merodach was to all appearance
        venerated, Nergal was worshipped as the god of death and disease,
        Ištar was held in high esteem. It must have been during those
        centuries of Babylonian rule that the worship of Tammuz or Adonis got
        into the country, becoming one of the stumbling-blocks of the
        Israelites in later days, when Hebrew women lamented for him, hidden
        in the realm of darkness where dwelt Persephone (Ereš-ki-gala,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the lady of the great domain”</span> of the
        Babylonians), into whose realm, at great risk, Ištar, his spouse,
        descended to seek him, but only escaped from the rival's clutches by
        the intervention of the gods.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Exceedingly
        interesting are the various forms of government in Western Asia at
        this period. Among hereditary chiefs may be mentioned Etakama of
        Gidši (Kadesh), Šum-addu, who is probably the same as Šamu-Addu,
        prince of Šamḫuna, Mut-zu'u (see p. <a href="#Pg286" class=
        "tei tei-ref">286</a>), and Azru, though this last is doubtful, as in
        one of the letters he calls himself a governor installed by the king
        of Egypt. The best example of an elected chief, however, is in all
        probability Yabitiri, governor of Gaza and Jaffa, who, when young,
        went down to Egypt and served in the Egyptian army, being afterwards
        appointed to the posts which he held later. The power of the Egyptian
        kings of a period somewhat preceding this is well exemplified by the
        fact, that Addu-nirari of Assyria attributes to an Egyptian ruler the
        appointment of his grandfather and father as <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page280">[pg 280]</span><a name="Pg280" id="Pg280" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> kings of Nuḫašše, on account of which all three
        rulers seem to have acknowledged Egyptian overlordship. An
        interesting instance of female rule is that of Nin-Urmuru (?),<a id=
        "noteref_57" name="noteref_57" href="#note_57"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">57</span></span></a> who, in
        her letters, mentions Ajalon and Sarḫa (identified with Zorah),
        probably lying in her district.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Most interesting
        of all, however, is the case of Jerusalem, whose ruler, as will be
        seen from the letters quoted later on, was apparently elected by some
        of the magnates of the district which acknowledged his sway, and who
        were probably the members of a religious community. Nothing, however,
        is known of the electorate or the system of election employed—all
        that can be said is, that the ruler was not placed there by virtue of
        his father or his mother, but by the <span class="tei tei-q">“mighty
        king.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The matter of the
        government of Dunip, one of the most important towns of ancient
        Palestine, is also of importance, as it does not seem to have
        possessed an autocratic head of any kind, and may have been a kind of
        republic. Its government was probably similar to that of Irqata,
        which was ruled over by its elders, acknowledging the overlordship of
        the Egyptian king. A similar state of things seems to have prevailed
        in Babylonia, where, however, the king of Babylon was naturally
        recognized as lord of the country. In all probability the towns
        governed by their elders were regarded as royal cities of Egypt,
        whilst the others were semi-independent states.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The relations of
        the Egyptian king with foreign states is well illustrated by the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is clear from
        this, and from other inscriptions of the series, that a kind of
        international law existed among the nations of the ancient East, by
        which they were expected to protect the caravans passing through each
        other's territory, and, in fact, see that no harm came to any of each
        other's subjects. They were expected to punish all persons who may
        have attacked and ill-treated or murdered them, and make restitution
        of property stolen. The law (probably an unwritten one) was evidently
        much the same as prevails among civilized nations at the present day.
        That these ancient rulers always obtained from their <span class=

        more than doubtful. Burra-buriaš's entreaty that his messenger might

        above all, the precious metal which was said to be so plentiful
        there, and for which all the rulers of Western Asia seem to have
        hungered. And this leads to the interesting statement in the fifth
        paragraph, in which gold in Egypt is said to have been as dust; and
        there is the question, <span class="tei tei-q">“Why should it go
        round into thine eyes?”</span> (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Amminî ina ênē-ka

        dust, and was in that respect undesirable, and therefore to be got
        rid of. He would like to have some for the decoration of his
        palace—his father, and the king of Ḫanigalbat had been favoured in
        this way. Let it not be as little (apparently), as that sent to the
        Ḫanigalbatian king, for that would not suffice to pay his messengers.
        The interchange of things needed as presents made good friends. It
        was a lawless band of Sutites who had detained the Egyptian king's
        messengers, and he was as one dead until his people had stopped their
        depredations. It was useful to a king that his ambassadors lived and
        died abroad, but not that they should be attacked and killed
        there.</p>

        Egyptian king to hold the scales of justice always even, for among
        the governors were always men who professed faithfulness, but who
        aimed at throwing off the Egyptian yoke, light as it was.</p>

        the trouble began in the north, that district being farthest from the
        Egyptian marches, and what was going on there was on that account
        longer in reaching the knowledge of the king. Judging from a letter

        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> officials were occupying cities in the
        territory known as Amki (identified with <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        (whose name also appears as Etagama, Etakkama, Itatkama, Itakama,
        Aiṭugama, and Aidaggama) joined the Hittite troops who were hostile
        to Egypt. It was in consequence of this, in all probability, that the
        three officials decided to write to the king of Egypt to let him know
        how things were going, and this they did in identical terms, with the
        same expressions, and the same peculiarities of spelling, pointing to
        the probability that the same scribe wrote all three communications.
        In the letter of Ili-rabiḫ, from which a quotation is given on p.
        <a href="#Pg288" class="tei tei-ref">288</a>, Amki is called
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the king's territory,”</span> implying that
        it was a tract acknowledging Egyptian supremacy, which Etagama was
        trying to wrest from the Pharaoh's grasp. It was the king's friends
        who were occupying the king's cities (as Bêri, Ilu-dâya, and the
        unknown writer call them), because they desired to hold them against
        this active enemy. With help from the Egyptian king, they thought
        that they would be able to do this without difficulty. There seems to
        be (as far as can at present be judged) no reason to suppose that the
        beginning of the expulsion of the Egyptians from Palestine was due to
        the over-zeal of the supporters of Egyptian rule in that country,
        who, striving to extend the influence and the dominions of their
        suzerain, drew down upon him, and upon themselves, the hostility of
        all the independent states of Western Asia, as well as of those which
        wished to throw off the Egyptian yoke. The Egyptian kings would
        surely have warned their vassals in Palestine against the danger of
        such action on their part.</p>

        spread, and the Hittites and their allies took possession of the
        territories south of the tracts referred to, trying, at the same
        time, to win over to their side the governors who were faithful. All
        this time posing as a friend of the Pharaoh, Etagama complained of
        the others, particularly Namya-waza, one of Egypt's most trustworthy
        allies, who, in a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page291">[pg
        291]</span><a name="Pg291" id="Pg291" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        letter couched in the usual humble style of the period, announces his
        readiness to serve <span class="tei tei-q">“with his horses and
        chariots, and with his brothers, and with his SA-GAS, and with his
        Sutites, along with the hired soldiers, whithersoever the king his
        lord should command him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now in this letter
        there is one noteworthy fact, and that is, that the SA-GAS and the
        Sutites are mentioned together as the allies of an important vassal
        of the Egyptian king, the latter being apparently wandering hordes of
        plunderers (see above, p. <a href="#Pg283" class=
        "tei tei-ref">283</a>), whom Kadašman-Muruš, king of Babylonia, sent
        from east to west <span class="tei tei-q">“until there were no
        more.”</span> This took place at a somewhat later date, so that they
        still roamed about the eastern portion of the country, between
        Palestine and Babylonia, apparently giving their services to any
        power which might desire to make use of them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The question of
        the identification of the troops or bands of warriors designated by
        the Akkadian compound SA-GAS is, however, of still greater
        importance. Most Assyriologists regard them as being identical with
        the Ḫabiri, mentioned in the letters of Abdi-tâbu or Ebed-tob. This,
        of course, is possible, but it is unfortunate that no direct
        confirmation of this identification exists. In the bilingual lists of
        Babylonia and Assyria, the expression SA-GAS, duly provided with the
        determinative prefix indicating a man or a class of men, occurs, and
        is always translated by the word <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ḳabbatu</span></span>, the probable meaning of
        which is <span class="tei tei-q">“robber,”</span> from the root
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ḫabātu</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“to plunder”</span>. It is also noteworthy that there is
        a star called SA-GAS, and this is likewise rendered by the same word,
        namely, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ḫabbatu</span></span>. The fact that it is once
        provided with the determinative <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ki</span></span>
        (<span class="tei tei-q">“place”</span>) does not help us, for this
        may be simply an oversight or a mannerism of the scribe. Moreover,
        the difficulty of identifying the SA-GAS with the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ḫabiri</span></span> of the inscriptions of
        Abdi-ṭâba is increased <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page292">[pg
        292]</span><a name="Pg292" id="Pg292" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> by
        the word occurring in these texts (Winckler's No. 216, l. 11),
        followed by the explanation (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">amēlūti
        ḫabati</span></span>), an arrangement which we find in others of
        these letters, when an ideograph has to be explained; and when they
        are, as here, Akkadian ideographs and Babylonian words, the second is
        always the pronunciation of the first—never the alternative reading.
        Indeed, in the present case, such an explanation would be misleading
        instead of helpful (were the word SA-GAS to be read <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ḫabiri</span></span>), for the scribe tells you
        to read it <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ḫabati</span></span>—the same word as is given
        in the bilingual lists, but spelled with one <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></em> instead
        of two.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In all
        probability, therefore, the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ḫabati</span></span>
        were wandering hordes differing from the Sutites in not having any
        special nationality, and being composed of the offscourings of many
        peoples of the ancient East. They were probably included in the
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ḫabiri</span></span>, together with the nations
        with which they were afterwards associated. The <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ḫabiri</span></span> were not the Hebrews,
        neither the word nor the date being what we should expect for that
        nationality, who were still in Egypt. The best identification as yet
        published is that of Jastrow, who connects it with the Hebrew Heber,
        the patronymic of various persons. Better still, however, would be
        the Heb. <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
        "he"><span style="font-style: italic">ḥaber</span></span>, pl.
        <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang="he"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">haberim</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“companions,”</span> also used of tribes joined together
        to form a nation. Whether an advance guard of the Hebrews is to be
        included in this term or not, must be left to the judgment of the
        student.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The gradual loss
        of the districts south of Damascus in all probability followed. A
        letter from Mut-Addu (the only one from him) to Yanḫamu speaks of the
        cities of the land of Garu (identified—though the identification is
        not quite satisfactory—with the Heb. Gur), namely Udumu (identified
        by Petrie with Adamah, though the form does not agree so well as
        might be wished, and Udumu is the usual way of rendering the word
        Edom, which is referred to in the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> cuneiform inscriptions both as a land and a
        city), Aduri (Petrie: et-Tireh), Araru (Petrie: Arareh), Meštu
        (Petrie: Mushtah), Magdali (Magdala), Ḫini-anabi (Ain-anab, if
        rightly identified—there is a certain difficulty in the word
        possessing a guttural at the beginning and not likewise as the first
        letter of the second component—probably 'Anab, south-west of Hebron,
        the Anab of Josh. xi. 21), and Sarki. At this time, according to the
        tablet, Hawani and Yabiši (Jabesh) had been captured. It is probably
        on account of the occupation of the country by so many hostile tribes
        that the protest of Burra-buriaš of Babylonia (see p. <a href=
        "#Pg281" class="tei tei-ref">281</a>) was sent, but it was in all
        probability exceedingly difficult for the Egyptian king to afford any
        protection whatever to the caravans which passed through the
        disaffected area.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the things
        which the Tel-el-Amarna letters show very clearly is, that it must
        have been very difficult for the Pharaoh to know who were his friends
        and who were his enemies among the rulers of the Philistines. The
        Amorite Abdi-Aširta and his allies were from the first desirous to
        throw off the Egyptian yoke, but this prince at the same time
        constantly sent letters to Amenophis IV. protesting his fidelity.
        Other chiefs who were hostile to Egypt are Etakama, the sons of
        Lab'aya, Milkîli, Yapa-Addu, Zimrêda of Sidon, Aziru, and others. On
        the king's side were Namyawaza, who held Kumidi (Petrie:
        Kamid-el-Lauz), Rib-Addi, whose chief cities were Gebal, Beyrout, and
        Simyra, Zimrêda of Lachish, and Abdi-ṭâba of Jerusalem. Numbers of
        chiefs, at first faithful, went over to the enemy when they saw the
        success of the league against the foreign power.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is impossible
        to suppose that the letters now known (about three hundred in number)
        represent all the correspondence which passed between Palestine and
        Egypt concerning the state of the country during the reigns of
        Amenophis III. and IV., and from the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> time the troubles there commenced, complaints
        and applications for help must have claimed the attention of the
        Egyptian translator literally in shoals. One of the most remarkable
        of these is the letter from the people of Dunip, who say that, in
        consequence of the state of things in Palestine, they belong no
        longer to the king of Egypt, to whom they had been sending for twenty
        years, but their messengers had been retained. Their prince (to all
        appearance) had been taken back to Egypt by the king's orders, after
        he had allowed him to return to his country, so that they had not
        seen him again. <span class="tei tei-q">“And now Dunip, thy city,
        weeps, and its tears flow, and there is no one to take our hands
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> help us). We have sent to the
        king, the lord, the king of Egypt, and not a single word from our
        lord hath reached us.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Were they really
        sorry to be no longer under Egyptian rule? or were they merely
        desirous that their prince should be restored to them?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During this
        period, naturally enough, recriminations were going on on every side.
        Those who were faithful very properly made complaints and uttered
        warnings concerning those who were unfaithful. The waverers, the
        unfaithful, and the hostile, on the other hand, were continually
        asserting their fidelity, and accusing those who were really
        well-disposed towards Egypt of all kinds of hostile acts against the
        supreme power. This is evident from the correspondence of Abdi-ṭâba
        of Jerusalem, who, in one of his letters, writes as follows—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“(T)o the king my lord say also thus: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘It is Abdi-ṭâba, thy servant. At the feet of my lord the
        king twice seven times and twice seven times I fall. What have I done
        against the king my lord? They back-bite—they slander<a id=
        "noteref_67" name="noteref_67" href="#note_67"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        before the king my lord, (saying): <span class="tei tei-q">“Abdi-ṭâba
        has fallen away from the king <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page295">[pg 295]</span><a name="Pg295" id="Pg295" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> his lord.”</span> Behold, (as for) me, neither
        my father nor my mother set me in this place—the arm of the mighty
        king caused me to enter into the house of my father. Why should I
        commit a sin against the king my lord? As the king my lord lives, I
        said to the commissioner of the king (my) lord: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Why love ye the Ḫabiri and hate the gover(nors)? it is
        on account of this that they utter slander before the king my
        lord.”</span> Then he said: <span class="tei tei-q">“The countries of
        the king my lord have rebelled, therefore they utter slander to the
        king my lord.”</span> ’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The ruler of
        Jerusalem then seems to say, that the king had placed a garrison in
        some city or other, but it had been taken, apparently by
        Yanḫamu—there was no longer a garrison (in that place). The king's
        cities under Ili-milku had revolted, the whole of the land of the
        king was lost, so let the king have care for his land. He would like
        to go to the king, to urge him to take action, but the people in his
        district were too mighty for him, and he could not leave it. As long
        as the king lived, and as long as he sent a commissioner, he would
        continue to give warning. If troops were sent that year, things would
        be saved, otherwise the king's lands would be lost. Abdi-ṭâba ends
        with an appeal to the scribe to place the matter clearly before the
        king.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another very
        important letter from Abdi-ṭâba is as follows—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“(T)o the king my lord, (my) Sun, (say also) thus:

        there is hostility against me. Even though one be a seer, one wishes
        not to see the tears of the king my lord, when enmity exists against
        me. As long as ships were in the midst of the sea, the power of the

        the Ḫabiru have taken the cities of the king. There is not one
        governor for the king my lord—all have rebelled. Behold, Turbazu has
        been killed at the gate of the city Zilû, (and) the king (?) remained
        inactive. Behold, (as for) Zimrêda of the city of Lakisu (Lachish),
        (his) servants lay in wait for him (?), they took (him) to kill (?)
        (him). Yapti'-Addu has been killed (at) the gate of the city of Zilû,

        send) troops to the land of (the city of Jerusalem, (?), and) if
        there are not troops this year, the whole of the lands of the king my
        lord are lost. They do not tell the king my lord (this). When the
        country of the king my lord is lost, then are lost (also) all the
        governors. If there be not troops this year, let the <span class=

        thus): <span class="tei tei-q">‘It is Abdi-ṭâba, (thy) servant. (I
        fall down) at (thy) feet. Cause (my) words to enter (pl)ainly to the

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The final phrase
        resembles that of an English letter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
        Petrie, Sêri is Shaaraim (Josh. xv. 36), now <span class=

        in Guti-Kirmil (Winckler, Gin(?)ti-Kirmil) be correctly drawn in the
        official published copy, there is considerable doubt as to the
        reading of the first syllable of this interesting name. Zilû, where
        Turbazu and Yapti'-Addu were killed, is identified by Petrie with
        Zelah, north of Jerusalem. This letter gives an excellent
        illustration of the state of the country at the time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another letter
        Abdi-ṭâba explains how all the lands had concluded a bond of
        hostility against him, and the districts of Gezer, Askelon, and
        Lachish had supplied these people with food. After this comes the
        usual request for troops, and the indication that, if troops be sent
        <span class="tei tei-q">“this year,”</span> the situation would be
        saved—next year there would be neither countries nor governors for
        the king (in Palestine). <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, this land
        of the city of Jerusalem, neither my father nor my mother gave it to
        me—the power of the mighty king gave it to me, (even) to me.”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“See,”</span> he continues, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“this deed is the deed of Milki-îli, and the deed of the
        sons of Lab'aya, who have given the land of the king to the
        Ḫabiri.”</span> He then goes on to speak of the Kaši, who seem to
        have supported the confederates with food, oil, and clothes. Next
        follows what Paura, the king's commissioner, had told him about the
        disaffection of Adaya. Caravans had been robbed in the field of the
        city of Yaluna (Ajalon), but <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class=

        "tei tei-q">“(I mention this) in order to inform thee.”</span>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, the king has placed his name in the
        land of Jerusalem for ever, and the forsaking of the lands of
        Jerusalem is not possible.”</span> After this comes the usual note to
        the scribe in Egypt, followed by a postscript referring to the people
        of Kâsi, disclaiming some evil deed which had been done to them.
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Do not kill a worthy servant (on that
        account”</span>).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Yet another letter
        refers to Milki-îli and Lab'aya: <span class="tei tei-q">“Behold, has
        not Milki-îli fallen away from the sons of Lab'aya and from the sons
        of Arzawa to ask the land of the king for them?<a id="noteref_74"
        name="noteref_74" href="#note_74"><span class=

        governor, who has done this deed, why has the king not called him to
        account for this?”</span> The narrative breaks off where Abdi-ṭâba
        begins to relate something further concerning Milki-îli and another
        named Tagi. When the text again becomes legible, Abdi-ṭâba is again
        referring to the fact that there is no garrison of the king in some
        place whose name is lost. <span class="tei tei-q">“Therefore—as the
        king lives—Puuru (= Pauru) has entered it—he has departed from my
        presence, (and) is in the city of Gaza. So let the king indicate to
        him (the necessity) of a garrison to protect the country. All the
        land of the king has rebelled. Send Ya'enḫamu (Yanḫamu), and let him
        become acquainted with (lit. let him know) the country of the king
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the true state of
        affairs”</span>). Here follows a note to the scribe in Egypt similar
        to that translated above.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One of the most
        interesting and instructive of the letters of Abdi-ṭâba is that which
        Petrie regards as the latest of the series; and on account of its
        importance, it is given in full here—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“(To) the king, my lord, (s)ay also thus: <span class=
        "tei tei-q">‘It is <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page299">[pg
        299]</span><a name="Pg299" id="Pg299" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        (Abdi)-ṭâba thy servant. At the feet of the (ki)ng my lord twice
        seven times and twice seven times I fall down. (Behold, the deed)
        which Milki-îli and Šu-ardatum have done to the land of the king my
        lord has been successful (?). The men of the city of Gazri (Gezer),
        the men of the city of Gimti (Gath), and the men of the city of Kîlti
        (Keilah) have been captured. The land of the city of Rubute has
        revolted. The land of the king (belongs to) the Ḫabiri. And now,
        moreover, a city of the land of Jerusalem, the city Beth-Ninip
        (<span class="tei tei-q">“House”</span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Temple of Ninip”</span>)—(this is) its name—has revolted
        to the people of Kîlti. Let the king hearken to Abdi-ṭâba thy
        servant, and let him send hired soldiers, and let me bring back the
        land of the king to the king. And if there be no hired soldiers, the
        land of the king will go over to the men, the Ḫabiri. This deed (is
        the deed of) Šu-ardatum (and) Milki-îli ... city ... and let the king
        care for his land.’</span> ”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether the fall
        of Jerusalem followed or not is doubtful; nor is it certain that the
        Egyptians were ultimately driven out. Other letters seem to show how
        the influence of those whom Abdi-ṭâba calls the Ḫabiri, and others
        the Ḫabati—the <span class="tei tei-q">“confederates”</span> and the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“plunderers”</span>—spread still farther
        southward. Naturally more information is required to enable it to be
        known in what manner the Egyptians tried to retrieve their position,
        and how it was that Amenophis IV. delayed so long the sending of
        troops. All the governors who were in the least degree faithful to
        Egypt united in repeatedly warning him as to what was taking place,
        and urging him to send troops. Had the rebellion or
        invasion—whichever it was—been nipped in the bud, Palestine would
        have remained a faithful Egyptian province. All the king did,
        however, was to send his commissioner, and, occasionally, exhorting
        and even threatening letters, which had in all probability little or
        no effect, except <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page300">[pg

        excite a little mild amusement on account of their erratic spelling.
        A very noteworthy communication of this class is the following—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As may easily be
        imagined, the expulsion of the Egyptians from Palestine left the
        country in a very disturbed state, and marauding bands, having no
        longer anything to do in the way of wresting territory from the
        Egyptians, must have given considerable trouble to the native princes
        and governors, now once more independent in their own
        territories.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The loss of
        Palestine, on the other hand, probably brought with it a certain
        amount of loss of prestige <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page303">[pg
        303]</span><a name="Pg303" id="Pg303" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to
        Egypt, which must have endured for some time. In any case, the
        Egyptian kings who succeeded Amenophis IV. seem to have made no
        attempt to regain the lost provinces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ankh-kheperu-Ra,
        the king who succeeded the ruler just named, lived for a while at
        Tel-el-Amarna, during which time, in all probability, the tomb of his
        predecessor's six daughters was finished. Several rings of this king
        exist, on two of which he calls himself <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“beloved of Nefer-kheperu-Ra”</span> (or, in accordance
        with the indications of the Tel-el-Amarna tablets: Nafar-khoperu-Ria)
        and <span class="tei tei-q">“beloved of Ua-en-Ra,”</span> names of
        Amenophis IV. During his reign the worship of the sun's disc (Aten,
        or, if the derivation from the Semitic Adon, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“lord,”</span> be correct, Aton) began to give way to
        that of the national gods of Egypt. He reigned thirteen years
        (1365-1353 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>), and was succeeded by
        Ra-kheperu-neb (1353-1344). The paintings in the tomb of Hui at
        Thebes show that tribute was still received from the Syrians
        (Rutennu), as well as from the people of Kush in the Soudan.
        Evidently the road was being paved for the conquest of the lost
        provinces of Syria.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this came a
        ruler who seems to have held the throne only on account of his wife
        being of royal blood. According to Petrie, he was <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“divine father Ay,”</span> and his wife's name was Ty. He
        reigned thirteen years (1344-1332 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>). During his reign a
        complete reversion to the old worship took place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ay's successor,
        Ra-ser-kheperu (Hor-em-heb), 1332-1328 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, was apparently also a
        commoner, and is identified (Petrie) with the Hor-em-heb who was
        general in an earlier reign. He is represented being adored by
        negroes and Asiatics.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">One or two other
        obscure names occur, and then begins the reign of king Rameses I.,
        who came to the throne about 1300 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> This reign was short
        enough, but there is hardly any doubt that in it the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> prosperity of Egypt was renewed. From the
        treaty of the Khita with Rameses II., the grandson of Rameses I., we
        learn that the latter had a war with the Khita, and from the fact
        that he founded a storehouse for the temple of his divine father
        Hor-khem, and filled it with captive men-servants and maid-servants,
        we may conclude that he was fairly successful in his warlike
        expeditions.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With his son, Seti
        (Sethos) I., or Meneptah (<span class="tei tei-q">“beloved of
        Ptah”</span>), we attain firmer ground. In the very first year of his
        reign he warred in the east, among the Shasu Bedouin, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“from the fortress of Khetam (Heb. Etham) in the land of
        Zalu, as far as Kan'ana (Canaan).”</span> Kadesh, at that time a city
        of the Kheta (it had apparently fallen into the hands of the Hittites
        during the reign of Amenophis IV.), was conquered by him. Not only
        the Hittites, however, but also Naharain (Naharaim), the country of
        which Dušratta of old had been king, upper and lower Rutennu (Canaan
        and North Syria), Sinjar, the island of Cyprus, and Cappadocia, felt
        the force of his arms. His son, Rameses II., was associated with him
        on the throne, and afterwards succeeded him. This took place about
        1300 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> It is to this ruler
        that the glory of the name of Rameses is principally due, and his
        grandfather, the first who bore it, shines mainly with a reflected
        light.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is impossible
        here to do more than touch upon such of the details of his career as
        are essential in the present work. In all probability he is best
        known on account of his expedition into Syria, and the conquest of
        the Hittites, who, as recorded in the celebrated heroic poem of
        Pentaur, were allied with a number of other tribes, including the
        people of Naharaim, Aleppo, Gauzanitis, the Girgashites (?),
        Carchemish, etc. The result was success for the Egyptian arms, and
        the Hittites, on the whole, submitted, though some of the towns
        acknowledging <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg
        305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Hittite rule, notably Tunep, refused to accept Egyptian suzerainty,
        necessitating another expedition, the result of which was, that the
        Egyptians found no more opposition to their overlordship. In his
        eighth and succeeding years he fought against the Canaanites, and in
        his descriptions of his operations there, many familiar names are to
        be found—names of great interest to all students of ancient Oriental
        history. It was in his eighth year, according to the texts in the
        Ramesseum, that he conquered Shalam (Salamis W. of Capernaum,
        according to Prof. Flinders Petrie), Marom (Merom), the spring of
        Anamimi (identified with Anamim), Dapur (identified with Tabor by
        Brugsch), and many other places.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Rameses II. is
        generally regarded as the Pharaoh of the Oppression, and one of the
        tasks placed upon the oppressed Israelites was the building of his
        store-cities, Pithom (Pi-tum, discovered by M. Naville when
        excavating for the Egypt Exploration Fund) and Raamses, the
        Pi-Ramessu of the inscriptions, concerning which there is a very
        interesting letter by an Egyptian named Panbesa, who visited it. As
        Brugsch says: <span class="tei tei-q">“We may suppose that many a
        Hebrew, perhaps Moses himself, jostled the Egyptian scribe in his
        wandering through the gaily-dressed streets of the
        temple-city.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The successor of
        Rameses, Meneptah II., is hardly the son which one would expect to
        follow such a father. According to Brugsch, he does not rank with
        those Pharaohs who transmitted their remembrance to posterity by
        grand buildings and the construction of new temples. And the monolith
        found by Petrie in 1896 seems to imply that his lists of conquests
        were not always so trustworthy as could be wished. Nevertheless, the
        reign of Meneptah is one of the greatest importance, for it was he,
        to all appearance, who was the Pharaoh of the Exodus, as seems also
        to be proved by the same document. As this is a <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page306">[pg 306]</span><a name="Pg306" id="Pg306"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> text of the very first importance, a
        translation of the concluding lines is given here—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Kheta (the land of the Hittites) is in peace, captive is
        Canaan and full of misery, Askelon is carried away, Gezer is taken,
        Yennuamma is non-existent, Israel is lost, his seed is not,<a id=
        "noteref_75" name="noteref_75" href="#note_75"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">75</span></span></a> Syria is
        like the widows of Egypt. The totality of all the lands is at peace,
        for whoever rebelled was chastised by king Meneptah.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Now the statement
        concerning Israel has given rise to a considerable amount of
        discussion. Naville regards the reference to the condition in which
        the Israelites were as indicating that they had left Egypt, and were
        wandering, <span class="tei tei-q">“lost”</span> in the desert. There
        is also some probability that the expression, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“his seed is not,”</span> may be a reference to the
        decree of the king, who commanded the destruction of the male
        children of the Hebrews, which command, he may have imagined, had
        been finally carried out. The question also naturally arises, whether
        the last phrase, <span class="tei tei-q">“whoever rebelled was
        chastised by king Meneptah,”</span> may not have a reference to the
        Israelites, who, from their own showing, were sufficiently peremptory
        in their demands to be allowed to proceed into the wilderness to
        sacrifice to their god, to bring down upon themselves any amount of
        resentment.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Exceedingly
        noteworthy, and in many respects startling, however, are the
        researches and statements of Dr. Edouard Mahler. Following
        Spiegelberg as to the meaning of the phrase containing the name of
        the Israelites, <span class="tei tei-q">“Jenoam has been brought to
        naught; Israel, the horde, destroyed his crops”</span>—a statement
        which hardly seems worthy of the honour of being inscribed on the
        memorial stele of a king of Egypt—is the rendering he suggests. The
        translation of the word <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">feket</span></span> (which is rendered by other
        Egyptologists as <span class="tei tei-q">“annihilated, lost,”</span>
        or in some similar way) by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page307">[pg
        307]</span><a name="Pg307" id="Pg307" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        <span class="tei tei-q">“horde,”</span> allows the learned
        chronologist to suggest, that the ideographs accompanying the word
        Israelites indicate that they had already entered the Holy Land, and
        were trying to obtain a foothold there.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having made these
        statements, he proceeds to examine the whole question. He asserts the
        correctness of the view, that Amosis, the founder of the eighteenth
        dynasty, was the prince who knew not Joseph. The first king of this
        new dynasty, he calculates, came to the throne two years after
        Joseph's death. With regard to the reign of Rameses II., he refers to
        the festival of the Sothis period which was celebrated in the
        thirtieth year of his reign. Starting from this period,<a id=
        "noteref_76" name="noteref_76" href="#note_76"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">76</span></span></a> which,
        according to Oppolzer, was renewed in the year 1318 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, he calculates that the
        first year of Rameses II. was 1347 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, and that the Exodus
        took place in his thirteenth year, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> 1335
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pirke di
        Rabbi Elieser</span></span>, Dr. Mahler says, the departure of the
        Israelites is said to have taken place on a Thursday. <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This view is also held in the Talmud (cf. Sabbath 87B),
        and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Shulchan-Aroch</span></span> also maintains that
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the 15th
        Nisan, the day of the Exodus, was a Thursday</span></em>. This all
        agrees with the year <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> 1335, for in that year
        the 15th Nisan fell on a Thursday, and indeed on <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Thursday the 27th of
        March (Julian calendar)</span></em>.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If we accept the
        theory that Rameses II. was the Pharaoh of the Exodus, and that the
        Exodus took place in 1335 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, then Moses, who was
        eighty years old at the time of the Exodus, must have been born in
        the year 1415 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> the
        fifteenth year of Amenophis III. Now the chief wife of this ruler was
        queen Teie (see p. <a href="#Pg275" class="tei tei-ref">275</a>), a
        woman who was certainly <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page308">[pg
        308]</span><a name="Pg308" id="Pg308" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        foreign, probably Asiatic, race. In all probability, therefore, Teie,
        being an alien and of a different religion from the Egyptians, was
        not by any means in favour with the Egyptian priesthood, however much
        the Pharaoh may have delighted in her. The daughter of such a woman,
        as will easily be understood, would find little or no opposition to
        the adoption by her of a child of one of the Hebrews, an Asiatic like
        her mother. This, of course, would explain excellently how it was
        that Moses came to be adopted and educated by an Egyptian princess at
        her father's court, and that he had no real sympathy with the people
        among whom he lived, though it raises somewhat of a difficulty, for
        it is hard to understand how the Egyptian king, sympathizing, as we
        may expect him to have done, with Asiatics, should have ordered the
        destruction of their children. Nevertheless, circumstances may easily
        have arisen to cause such a decree to be issued. Another difficulty
        is, to explain who the people hostile to Moses were, who in the
        thirteenth year of Rameses II. died (Exod. iv. 19). This has
        generally been understood to be the king and one or more of his
        advisers, though this objection, like the other, really presents no
        difficulty worthy of the name, as there was no indication that the
        king was included.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Of course there is
        no statement to the effect that Pharaoh was killed with his army by
        the returning flood after the Israelites crossed the Red Sea (in Ps.
        cxxxvi. 15 he must be regarded as having been overwhelmed therein in
        the persons of his warriors, who suffered the fate which ought to
        have stricken also the king), so that little or no difficulty exists
        in this portion of the narrative.<a id="noteref_77" name="noteref_77"
        href="#note_77"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">77</span></span></a> On the
        other hand, a difficulty is got rid of if we suppose that the Exodus
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page309">[pg 309]</span><a name="Pg309"
        id="Pg309" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> took place in the time of
        Rameses II. Dr. Mahler points out, that Meneptah was succeeded by his
        son and heir, User-kheperu-Ra', who did not die, but reigned
        thirty-three years. The eldest sons of Rameses II., on the other
        hand, all died during their father's lifetime, and it was the
        fourteenth of his numerous progeny who ultimately came to the
        throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Dr. Mahler
        clinches the matter by making the plague of darkness to have been a
        solar eclipse.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever may be
        the defects of Dr. Mahler's seductive theory, it must be admitted
        that it presents fewer difficulties than any other that has yet been
        put forward, and on that account deserves special attention.</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">Amorites.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The earliest
          mention of the Amorites in the Old Testament is the passage in Gen.
          x. 16, where the name occurs along with that of the Jebusites and
          the Girgashites, from which may be gathered that they were all
          three very powerful tribes, though their power is in all
          probability not to be measured by the order of their names, the
          most important of the three being the Amorites, whose name comes
          second. They were regarded by the ancient Jews as an iniquitous and
          wicked people (Gen. xv. 6; 2 Kings xxi. 11), though they may not,
          in reality, have been worse than other nations which were their
          contemporaries. That they were a powerful nation is implied by the
          statement in Gen. xlviii. 22, where Jacob speaks of the tract which
          he had taken out of the hand of the Amorite with his sword and his
          bow, as a feat of which a warrior might be proud.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Amorites in
          Babylonia have already been referred to in Chap. <a href=
          "#Chapter_V" class="tei tei-ref">V.</a>, and from that part of the
          present work it will easily be understood that they were an
          extensive and powerful nationality, capable, with organization, of
          extending their power, as they <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page311">[pg 311]</span><a name="Pg311" id="Pg311" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> evidently did from time to time, far and
          wide. Indeed, as has been pointed out, there is great probability
          that the Babylonian dynasty called by Berosus Arabic, was in
          reality Amorite. In any case, the kings of this dynasty held sway
          over Amoria, as the inscription of Ammi-ṭitana, translated on p.
          <a href="#Pg155" class="tei tei-ref">155</a>, clearly shows. The
          importance of this nationality in the eyes of the Babylonians is
          proved by the fact that their designation for <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“west”</span> was <span class="tei tei-q">“the land of
          Amurrū,”</span> and the west wind was, even with the Assyrians,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the wind of the land of Amurrū”</span>
          (though the Hittites, in Assyrian times, seem to have been the more
          powerful nation), and this designation of the western point of the
          compass probably long outlived the renown of the nationality from
          which the expression was derived. Among other Biblical passages,
          testifying to the power of the Amorites, may be quoted as typical
          Amos ii. 9, 10, and in this the Babylonian and the Hebrew records
          are quite in agreement.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As has been
          pointed out by Prof. Sayce, in process of time a great many
          tribes—Gibeonites, Hivites, Jebusites, and even Hittites—were
          classed as Amorites by the ancient Jewish writers, a circumstance
          which likewise testifies to the power of the nationality. These
          identifications must be to a large extent due to the fact that all
          the tribes or nationalities referred to were mountaineers, and, as
          we have seen (p. <a href="#Pg122" class="tei tei-ref">122</a>), the
          Akkadian character for a mountainous region or nationality, stood
          not only for Armenia, and the land of the Amorites, but also for
          the land of Akkad, because the Akkadians came from a mountainous
          country, perhaps somewhere in the neighbourhood of the mountains of
          Elam. This character was pronounced Ari when it stood for Amoria,
          but ceased to be used for that on account of its signifying also
          the mountainous region of Armenia, and Akkad, for which it still
          continued to be employed, and it is only the context, <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page312">[pg 312]</span><a name="Pg312" id="Pg312"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> in many cases, which enables the reader
          to gather which is meant. Other groups used for Amoria were the
          sign for foot, twice over (sometimes with one of them reversed),
          [Cuneiform], and [Cuneiform], the ordinary pronunciation of which
          is Saršar, though it is probable that the latter was pronounced, in
          Akkadian, like the former, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Tidnu. In the inscriptions
          of Gudea, viceroy of Lagaš about 2700 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, there occurs the
          name of a country called Tidalum, <span class="tei tei-q">“a
          mountain of Martu,”</span> from which a kind of limestone was
          brought. This Hommel and Sayce regard as another form of Tidnu, by
          the interchange of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">l</span></em> and <em class=
          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">n</span></em>,
          which is not uncommon in Akkadian. The fact that Martu is also used
          in the inscriptions for Amurrū, (the land of) the Amorites, and
          also, with the prefix for divinity, for the Amorite god
          (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">îlu
          Amurrū</span></span>), which was introduced into Babylonia at an
          exceedingly early date, confirms this explanation. In all
          probability there is not at present sufficient data for
          ascertaining the dates when these names first appear, but Tidnu or
          Tidalu was probably the earlier of the two.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What the exact
          boundaries of the district were are doubtful. Prof. Sayce, after
          examining the Tel-el-Amarna tablets, comes to the conclusion that
          it denoted the inland region immediately to the north of the
          Palestine of later days. In this Petrie concurs, the country being,
          according to him, the district of middle and lower Orontes, and
          certainly covering a large area. This, of course, would be the
          position of the tract over which they held sway in the earlier
          ages, but later they must have extended their power so as to
          embrace the Jebusites (Jerusalem), and even Mamre in Gen. xiv. 13.
          From this wide extension of the dominions of the Amorites in the
          book of the Bible dealing with the earliest period of Jewish
          history, and from the fact that the Assyro-Babylonians used the
          word to indicate the west in general, it is clear that the Amorites
          occupied a wide tract in the earlier <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page313">[pg 313]</span><a name="Pg313" id="Pg313" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> ages, and must have been pushed gradually
          back, probably by the Babylonians under Sargon of Agadé, leaving,
          however, centres of Amorite influence in the south, which, when the
          power of Egypt, which followed that of Babylonia, waned and
          disappeared, left certain independent states under Amorite rulers.
          It is thus that, at the time of the Exodus, we find Og ruling at
          Bashan, who had threescore cities, all the region of Argob, his
          chief seats being Edrei and Ashtaroth. This ruler and his people
          were of the remnant of the Rephaim, regarded by Sayce as of Amorite
          origin (Hastings's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span></span>, under
          <span class="tei tei-q">“Amorites”</span>). Whatever doubt there
          may be, however, about the origin of the Bashanites, there is none
          concerning Sihon king of the Amorites dwelling more to the south. A
          man of great courage and daring, he had driven the Moabites out of
          their territory, obliging them to retreat across the Arnon. On the
          entry of the Israelites, he gathered his troops and attacked them,
          but was defeated and killed. Josephus (<span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Ant.</span></span>
          iv. 5, sect. 2) has some curious details of this battle, in which
          he states that the Amorites were unable to fight successfully when
          away from the shelter of their cities, but in view of their
          successes against the Moabites, we may be permitted to doubt
          this.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
          Tel-el-Amarna tablets the ruler of the Amorites is apparently
          Abdi-Aširti,<a id="noteref_78" name="noteref_78" href=

          with his son Aziru, warred successfully against Rib-Addi
          (Rib-Hadad), governor of Phœnicia, driving him from Ṣumuru and
          Gublu (Gebal), which last city was occupied, according to Petrie's
          analysis, by the two hostile parties in turn. Naturally there are a
          great many recriminations on the part of Rib-Addi against
          Abdi-Aširti on account of the hostility between them, and the
          former is constantly complaining to the Pharaoh of what the latter
          had done, frequently calling him a dog, and once seemingly
          referring to the Amorites <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page314">[pg
          314]</span><a name="Pg314" id="Pg314" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          as <span class="tei tei-q">“dogs.”</span> (Elsewhere Abdi-Aširti
          applies this word to himself as an expression of humility.) His
          letters to the king of Egypt, however, are merely assurances of
          fidelity, and are all short:—</p>

          And may the king my lord know that strong is the hostility against

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(It is here
          worthy of note, that he does not, in this letter, call himself
          Abdi-Aširti, <span class="tei tei-q">“servant of the
          Ashera,”</span> but Abdi-Aštarti, <span class="tei tei-q">“servant
          of Astarte,”</span> using the Assyro-Babylonian ideograph for
          Ištar, the original of the goddess in question. On another document
          from him, the word is spelled out, Ab-di-aš-ta-ti, in which the
          scribe intended to write Ab-di-aš-ta-ar-ti, but omitted the last
          character but one. Yet another letter gives his name as
          Abdi-Aš-ra-tum, in the second element of which we must see another
          form of Abdi-Aširti, unless the scribe has also made a mistake in
          this case, and written Ašratum for Aštaratum, which is just
          possible. In any case, it shows a close connection between the
          goddess Aštarte or Ištar, and the Ashera, which was in Palestine,
          at that date, and for centuries before and after, her emblem. To be
          the servant of the one was to be the servant of the other, though
          the bearer of the name seems to have the desire rather to be
          considered the priest of the goddess. Even unintentional variants
          in names furnish valuable contributions at times to comparative
          mythology.)</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If there are but

          extent, from the son. He, too, is the faithful servant of the
          Pharaoh, and he writes also to Dûdu (a form of the name David) and
          Ḫâi, telling of the difficulties which he had with regard to the
          king of the Hittites. It is apparently this prince to whom the
          Pharaoh writes in the letter translated on pp. <a href="#Pg300"
          class="tei tei-ref">300-302</a>, a circumstance which leads to the
          belief that the complaints of Rib-Addi with regard to Abdi-Aširti
          and his son Aziru were well-founded. That the king of Egypt asks
          therein for the delivery to him of certain persons whom he names,
          implies that he had trustworthy information as to who the
          intriguers were, and though apparently willing to give Aziru the
          benefit of the doubt, he certainly did not hold him blameless.</p>

          be long ere the true order of these letters is known, and until

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
          nationality which took a predominant part in the politics of
          ancient Palestine is the Hittites. To all appearance they were a
          later power than the Amorites, as their name does not occur in the
          inscriptions of Babylonia and Assyria until a comparatively late
          date, whilst the Amorites are mentioned 2200 years before Christ,
          and their name had become the common Assyro-Babylonian expression
          for <span class="tei tei-q">“the west.”</span> That the Hittites
          were nevertheless of considerable antiquity, however, is implied by
          the presence of the sons of Heth at Mamre in the time of Abraham,
          who purchased from Ephron the Hittite the cave of Machpelah in that
          place. It is difficult to assign to these people any definite
          limits, especially in early times, but it seems certain that they
          began to act far in the north, and gradually extended their power
          southwards. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg
          316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          In the times of Joshua, the tract between the Lebanon and Euphrates
          is described as theirs, and their domain was, in fact, the country
          to the north of Palestine. It was no doubt due to their
          predominating power that the Assyrians of later days called the
          whole of Palestine <span class="tei tei-q">“the land of
          Ḫatti,”</span> a designation not altogether correct, but sufficient
          for their purpose, namely, that of indicating the position of the
          nationalities enumerated. Nevertheless, it had some justification,
          several colonies of these people inhabiting that district, as is
          indicated by Gen. xxiii. 3, xxv. 10; Numbers xiii. 29, etc. The
          statement in Ezekiel xvi. 3, that the father of Jerusalem was an
          Amorite and its mother a Hittite, shows what was the opinion of the
          more learned Jews of the time in the matter.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The earliest
          mention of the Hittites outside the Bible is in the Egyptian
          monuments, where, in the annals of Thothmes III., it is recorded
          for the year 1470 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, that the king
          proceeded to the banks of the Euphrates, and received tribute from
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the greater”</span> land of the Hittites.
          In the year 1463 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, the king of this
          district again paid tribute. During the reign of Thothmes IV.,
          grandson of Thothmes III., the relations between the two countries
          must have changed, and the Egyptian king had to repel an attack
          made by the Hittites upon Tunib (now Tennib) in Northern Syria.
          This hostile policy was continued by them also at a later date, for
          the successors of Thothmes IV., Amenophis III. and his son,
          Amenophis IV., had often to oppose the Hittite king, who either
          attacked Northern Syria, or stirred up strife among the Egyptian
          vassals in Canaan.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, again, the
          Tel-el-Amarna tablets come in, and supply a mass of details. At
          times the Ḫatti still send tribute, both to Amenophis III. and IV.,
          but at the close of the reign of the former, hostilities again
          broke out, the Hittites being, to all appearance, the aggressors.
          Dušratta, king of Mitanni, writes <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> that he sends to the king of Egypt tribute of
          the spoils which he had taken from the Ḫatti; and the king of
          Nuḫašše, who bears the Assyrian name of Addu-nirari, and whose
          grandfather had been appointed by Thothmes III., complains that the
          king of the Ḫatti is against him, and asks for help. From these and
          other statements it would seem, that whoever was on the side of the
          king of Egypt was the enemy of the Hittites, and therefore to be
          attacked by them. Akizzi, king of Qatna, complains in one of the
          letters that the Ḫatti had burned down a city, and reports in
          another that they had tried to win him over to their side. Aziru,
          another prince in the neighbourhood, complains that the king of
          Ḫatti has entered Nuḫašše, and for this reason he could not leave
          his own territory to go to the king of Egypt. At the end of one of
          his communications, Akizzi states that the Sun-god had taken away
          the king of the Ḫatti, but as no name is given, any historical
          importance which this fact might have is greatly minimized. In
          other letters they are spoken of as despoiling the princes of
          Gebal, capturing a personage named Lupakku and the cities of Amki
          <span class="tei tei-q">“even from the cities of Aaddu”</span> (or
          Bin-Addu = Ben-Hadad). As we have seen (pp. <a href="#Pg288" class=
          "tei tei-ref">288-289</a>), at least a portion of them was led by
          Etakama of Kinza.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As is well
          known, a large number of hieroglyphic inscriptions of a people
          regarded as the Hittites exist, and many attempts have been made to
          translate them. In addition to these, there are many sculptures,
          mostly on rocks, and still <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">in
          situ</span></span>. The most remarkable of these are at Bogaz Keui,
          Eyouk, Iasili-Kaia, Ghiaour-kalesi, Doganlu-deresi, Ibriz,
          Eflatun-bunar, Karabeli, and elsewhere in Asia Minor, as well as at
          Jerabis (anciently called Carchemish), Hamah (Hamath), and
          monuments of the Hittites have even been found at Babylon. How they
          came to this last place is not at present known, but they may have
          formed part <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg
          318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          of the spoils brought from the west by any of the later conquerors
          (such a supposition would probably be better than attributing to
          them a very early date), or sent thither as presents or as
          specimens of Hittite work. It is noteworthy that the inscriptions,
          with the exception of the bowl brought from Babylon, are all in
          relief and boustrophedon. A large number of seals, both of the
          ordinary kind and cylindrical, are known, and though there are
          bilingual inscriptions (Hittite and Babylonian), none of them are
          of sufficient length to make them really serviceable in translating
          other texts in the same character.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding
          the great difficulty attending such a task as the translation of
          these inscriptions, a certain amount of success has been attained.
          Those who have advanced the study most are Prof. Sayce in England,
          and Profs. Jensen and Hommel in Germany. It will be many years,
          however (unless some unexpected help come to light), before
          renderings in any real sense of the word useful can be made.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the opinion
          of Prof. Sayce, Cappadocia was the earliest home of this
          nationality, which spread thence in every direction (except,
          perhaps, northwards), and made itself master of a part of
          Palestine, from which circumstance the district came to have, in
          Assyrian literature, the name of <span class="tei tei-q">“the land
          of Ḫatti.”</span> Though later than the Amorite invasion, it
          nevertheless took place at a very early date, as is shown by the
          fact that Abraham had dealings with Ephron, a Hittite or
          <span class="tei tei-q">“son of Heth.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Coming down to a
          later date, it is interesting to see what is said about them by the
          kings of Assyria. Tiglath-pileser I. (about 1120 B.C.) says as
          follows—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Farther on in
          his record, Tiglath-pileser I. states that he collected his
          chariots and warriors, and took to the desert, going to the
          border-people of the Arameans, enemies of Ašur his lord. From
          before the land of Sūḫi (the Shuhites) as far as the city
          Carchemish of the land of Ḫattê, he boasts of having plundered in a
          single day, slaughtering their soldiers, and taking back to his own
          country all their property. Some of them fled across the Euphrates,
          followed by the Assyrians in boats of skins, and the result of this
          flight to seek safety was, that six of their cities at the foot of
          the mountain known as Bišru, were taken, plundered, and
          destroyed.</p>

          Commagene—is especially worthy of notice. It reads as follows—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the above
          extract the names containing that of the god Tešub show clearly
          that we have here to do with nationalities in the neighbourhood of
          Mitanni (see p. <a href="#Pg277" class="tei tei-ref">277</a>), and
          a close relation with the Hittites is suggested by the other name
          Ḫattu-šar, father of Šadi-Tešub, which is an analogous formation to
          Ḫattu-šil, the Kheta-sir of Egyptologists, with whom Rameses II.
          made a treaty (cf. p. <a href="#Pg304" class=
          "tei tei-ref">304</a>). Another reading of Ḫattu-šar is Ḫattuḫi, a
          name which Prof. <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page321">[pg
          321]</span><a name="Pg321" id="Pg321" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          Sayce translates, <span class="tei tei-q">“the Hittite,”</span> in
          the second series of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Records of the Past</span></span>, vol. i. p.
          97, note 2. In the same passage he analyzes the name of the city
          Urraḫinaš as being derived from Urra, with the termination
          <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">ḫi-naš</span></span>, denoting in Vannite,
          <span class="tei tei-q">“the place of the people of.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
          interesting reference to the Hittites is that of the Assyrian king
          Aššur-naṣir-âpli, renowned for his cruelty. The king ruling at the
          time was Sangara, who had as his capital the city of Carchemish.
          The text reads as follows—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“I drew near to the land of Carchemish. The tribute of
          Sangara, king of the land of Ḫatte—20 talents of gold, bangles (?)
          of gold, rings of gold, swords of gold, 100 talents of bronze, 250
          talents of iron, dishes of bronze, vases of bronze, libation-vases
          of bronze, a brazier of bronze, and the numerous vessels of his
          palace, the weight of which was not taken; couches of oak, chairs
          of oak, tables of oak and ivory inlaid, 200 slave-girls (or
          virgins), cotton stuffs, woollen cloth, white and black and white
          and grey, white marble (?), tusks of elephants, a white chariot, an
          umbrella of gold filled with overlaying (?), the ornament of his
          royalty, I received. The chariots, horses, (and) grooms of the city
          Carchemish, (of the Hittites<a id="noteref_82" name="noteref_82"
          href="#note_82"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">82</span></span></a>) I set
          (aside) for myself.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The riches and
          importance of the city of Carchemish are here well indicated, and
          to all appearance the place maintained its position to the end,
          long after the power of the Hittites had completely disappeared.
          Indeed, as will be recognized from the above, Sangara has every
          appearance of having been a local ruler, implying that the district
          under Hittite control was already broken up into small states
          practically independent of each other. Another prince of the
          Hittites, in the neighbourhood of Diarbekir, from whom this
          Assyrian <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg
          322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          king received tribute was <span class="tei tei-q">“the son of
          Baḫiani.”</span> Apparently he was called thus on account of his
          ancestor, Baḫiani, being chief of a tribe, the district over which
          he ruled bearing, in Aššur-naṣir-âpli's second reference to it, the
          name of Bît-Baḫiani, <span class="tei tei-q">“the house of
          Baḫiani.”</span> The special products of this tract are well
          indicated by the nature of the gifts sent to the Assyrian king:
          <span class="tei tei-q">“chariots, harness, horses, silver, gold,
          lead, bronze, and vessels of bronze.”</span> That these Hittite
          districts paid tribute so submissively would seem to indicate that
          they had no coherence among themselves, and did not feel called
          upon to aid each other in time of need.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sargon of
          Assyria, who claims to have subjugated all the land of the
          Hittites, speaks, as do other Assyrian kings, of the people of
          Hamath, and what he did to Ilu-bi'idi or Yau-bi'idi, their king.
          This, too, was the capital of a Hittite principality, and it is in
          the modern town of Hamah, in which form the name still survives,
          that the so-called <span class="tei tei-q">“Hamah-stones,”</span>
          now generally regarded as Hittite, were found.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
          disappearance of the Hittite confederate states (if such they
          really were), and the rise in their place from time to time of
          other powers, caused the Assyrians, who regarded this territory as
          their own special possession, won by conquest, to apply to the
          whole district the name of mât <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ḫatti</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the land of Heth,”</span> which would seem to have
          included (probably in its extended sense) Samaria, Sidon, Arvad,
          Gebal, Ashdod, Beth-Ammon, Moab, Edom, Askelon, and Judah.<a id=
          "noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a> It
          thus, to all appearance, took the place of the ancient <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“land of the Amorites”</span> (not, however, when
          indicating the points of the compass), and in this the inscriptions
          of Esarhaddon and Aššur-banî-âpli agree.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What the
          influence of the Hittites over the nations <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page323">[pg 323]</span><a name="Pg323" id="Pg323" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> contemporary with them may have been is
          difficult to estimate. The Assyrians, to all appearance, borrowed
          from them a certain style of architecture, used for the
          entrance-hall of the royal palaces. Their style of art, of which
          numerous examples are preserved, shows that they had made
          considerable progress, and that they had individuality as artists.
          Neither in sculpture nor in engraving of hard stone, however, did
          they ever attain to the exquisite fineness and finish of the best
          work of the artists of Babylonia and Assyria. The subjects, too,
          seem to be usually more grotesque, though this suggestion, which
          their work gives, may be due merely to our ignorance of their
          religious beliefs and the legends on which the designs were
          probably based.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inscribed
          vase in the British Museum, and the inscribed figure found by the
          German explorers at the same place have already been referred to
          (pp. <a href="#Pg317" class="tei tei-ref">317-318</a>), and it has
          been suggested as probable that they were sent as presents to one
          or more of the Babylonian kings, though the possibility that they
          were part of the spoils of an expedition to that part of the world,
          or specimens of Hittite art carried off at a later date, when the
          nations producing them had passed away, are also probable
          explanations. In any case, they seem to show that there were, at
          some period or other, political relations between the Hittites and
          the Babylonians.</p>

          <span style="font-size: 144%">Jebusites.</span></h2>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The importance
          of the Jebusites, who were, to all appearance, but a small tribe,
          lies in the circumstance, that their capital and stronghold, at the
          time the Israelites entered the Holy Land, was Jerusalem. In
          consequence of this, Jerusalem is mentioned, in one or two places
          (Jud. xix. 10; 1 Chron. xi. 4, 5, etc.), apparently poetically,
          under the name of Jebus, perhaps <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page324">[pg 324]</span><a name="Pg324" id="Pg324" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> so called by the Jebusites because of its
          being the capital of their tribe. The original name of the city,
          however, as we know from Gen. xiv. and the Tel-el-Amarna tablets
          (see p. <a href="#Pg239" class="tei tei-ref">239</a>), was
          Uru-salim. When the Jebusites took possession of the city, however,
          is unknown, but in all probability neither Melchizedek nor
          Abdi-ṭâba belonged to the race.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apart from the
          references to this tribe in connection with Jerusalem, there is no
          indication as to its origin and race. The name of their ruler,
          Adoni-zedek, however, seems to show clearly that they were Semites,
          and we may suppose, with Driver, that they were Canaanites
          (Hastings, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Dict. of the Bible</span></span>, s.v.). It is
          apparently one of the tribes of which the Babylonian and Assyrian
          inscriptions know nothing as a body, but the name of Yabušu, which
          would be the old form of Jebus, occurs in a contract tablet of the
          time of the first dynasty of Babylon (about 2200 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>), and, if really the
          name of the tribe, as it would seem to be, confirms its antiquity,
          as indicated by the references to it in Genesis.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not
          improbable that future discoveries will give us more information
          concerning this tribe, interesting principally on account of its
          having come into contact with the Jews.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This nation,
          descended from the fifth son of Canaan, seems to have inhabited the
          tract on the western bank of the Jordan, and on that account was
          not within easy reach of the Babylonians and Assyrians. The name,
          it is thought, is closely connected with that of Gergesa, where
          Christ healed the demoniac, and allowed the evil spirits to enter
          into the herd of swine which then ran down the slope into the sea.
          This Gergesa has, in its turn, been identified with Kersa, a ruined
          town near the mouth of the Wady <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page325">[pg 325]</span><a name="Pg325" id="Pg325" class=

          probability that the Girgashites are the Kirkišāti of a tablet from
          Assyria which seemingly contains an early historical record, or an
          historical legend. Whether the Kirkišāti be identical with the
          Girgashites or not, the text is of sufficient importance to make it
          a valuable record, and a translation of the more perfect and
          interesting of the lines is given here—</p>

          For a time, in all probability, it was like an Egyptian province,
          or, at least, greatly under Egyptian influence. It is not until
          comparatively late times that the Moabites come before us in
          Assyrian history, and the same thing may be said with regard to the
          Edomites, Ammonites, and other petty states. As these will be
          referred to incidentally in the chapters which follow, it has been
          thought well not to treat of them here, in order to avoid
          repetition as much as possible.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Hebrew
        commonwealth had come into being, and given place to a monarchy,
        which, passing through many vicissitudes, reached its highest pitch
        of glory in the time of David and Solomon, to suffer, after the death
        of the latter, diminution by the falling away of the ten tribes. Thus
        weakened, the two parts of what had been erstwhile a powerful whole
        became tempting morsels to any power whose ruler was ambitious of
        conquest. It was probably more from unwillingness to attack with but
        little chance of success than inability from inherent weakness which
        caused the Assyrians to refrain whilst the nation was united.
        Generally, the kings of Assyria preferred making conquests nearer
        home, and Tukulti-Ninip I., who reigned in the 13th century
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, annexed Babylonia and
        ruled there for seven years, Assyrian predominance in that land
        coming to an end on his death, which was due to a revolt, in which
        his son, Aššur-naṣir-âpli, took part. Though this was a check to
        Assyrian ambition in that quarter, its kings returned from time to
        time to the attack, but with very varying success, which probably
        caused them to turn their attention to other districts as the field
        of their warlike zeal. Tukulti-Ninip II. (891-885 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>) and his son,
        Aššur-naṣir-âpli II., therefore aimed at the conquest of the north
        and <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page328">[pg 328]</span><a name=
        "Pg328" id="Pg328" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> west, and though the
        latter came into conflict with Babylonia, no permanent accession of
        territory resulted therefrom.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It seems not to
        have been until somewhat late in his reign that he reached, in his
        numerous expeditions, the Mediterranean Sea, <span class=

        calls it. Here, after performing ceremonies to the gods of Assyria,
        he received the tribute of the kings of the sea-coast—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“of the land of the Tyrians, the land of the Sidonians,
        the land of the Gebalites, the land of the Maḫallatites, the land of
        the Maizites, the land of the Kaizites, the land of the Amorites,
        (and) the city of Arvad, which is amid the sea.”</span> This is
        followed by a list of the objects received, and the statement that
        they (the rulers) paid him homage. Having thus spied out the
        nakedness of the land, and ascertained the willingness of the rulers
        to give tribute, the Assyrian king proceeded to the mountains of
        Ḫamanu (Amanus), and cut beams of cedar, cypress, and other wood for
        the temple Ê-šarra, for his house or temple (apparently that in which
        he worshipped), <span class="tei tei-q">“a house of rejoicing, (and)
        for the temple of the moon and the sun, the glorious
        gods.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Shalmaneser II.,
        son of Aššur-naṣir-âpli, during the first six years of his reign,
        warred, like his father, on the north and west, his object being to
        complete what his father had begun, namely, the subjugation of the
        territory of Aḫuni, son of Adini, king of Til-barsip. This having
        been successfully accomplished, he was free to turn his attention to
        the more southern regions of the old land of the Amorites. In the
        year 854 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, therefore, he marched
        against Giammu, a ruler whose land lay on the river Belichus. To all
        appearance this chief wished to resist, but his people feared the
        power of the Assyrian king, and put Giammu to death. Taking
        possession of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page329">[pg
        329]</span><a name="Pg329" id="Pg329" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        district, he then proceeded to further successes, and after crossing
        the Euphrates again in boats of skins, he received the tribute of the
        kings on the farther side—Sangara of Carchemish, Kundašpu of
        Commagene, Aramu the son of Gusu, Lallu the Milidian, Ḫaianu the son
        of Gabaru, Kalparuda of the Patinians, and Kalparuda of the
        Gurgumians, <span class="tei tei-q">“(at) the city Aššur-uttir-aṣbat,
        of the farther side of the Euphrates, which is upon the river Sajur,
        which the men of the Hittites call the city Pitru”</span> (Pethor).
        Having reached Aleppo, he received also tribute there, and offered
        sacrifices before Hadad of Aleppo.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next came the turn
        of Irḫulêni of Hamath (Amatâa), whose cities Adennu, Pargâ, and

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such is the
        account of the first recorded contact of the Assyrians with the
        Jews—that is, if Sir'ilâa be rightly rendered <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Israelites”</span>; as to Ahab, there may have been more
        than one of the name, just as there were two Kalparudas, he of the
        Patinians, and he of the Gurgumians. Nevertheless, the probability
        that it really is Ahab of Israel is great, and this theory is held by
        most Assyriologists.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In truth, however,
        the Hebrew and the Assyrian histories of this period are not
        altogether easy to reconcile. Ben-Hadad II., the son and successor of
        Ben-Hadad I., was in almost continual conflict with the Israelites.
        The story is told in 1 Kings xx., according to which Ben-Hadad
        entered into an alliance with thirty-two other kings, who, with their
        armies, horses, and chariots, besieged Samaria. Too full of
        confidence, he sent to Ahab of Israel, who was in the besieged city,
        demanding his surrender, the second time with terms more than usually
        humiliating. In consequence of the words of a prophet who is unnamed,
        the rejection of these terms was followed by a sortie of the
        inhabitants, who seem to have taken the besiegers unawares, whilst
        they were feasting and drinking in their over-confidence. The result
        was the raising of the siege, and the complete defeat of the allied
        forces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next attack of
        Ben-Hadad upon Ahab was at Aphek, he hoping to obtain a victory over
        the Israelites because he considered their God to be a god
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page331">[pg 331]</span><a name="Pg331"
        id="Pg331" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of the mountains, and that
        they would not be under his protection in the plains. Here, too, the
        Israelites were victorious, and Ben-Hadad submitted, and agreed to
        restore cities taken by his father (xx. 34), and to allow the
        Israelites to build streets at Damascus (probably as a quarter for
        Jewish merchants).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Admitting the
        correctness of the general opinions of Assyriologists concerning
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Aḫabbu
        mât Sir'ilâa</span></span>, it must have been between this period and
        his death that he joined the Syrian league against Shalmaneser II. of
        Assyria, with a force only half that of Ben-Hadad, though his
        chariots were nearly twice as many. Notwithstanding this, however,
        the Israelitish troops were sufficiently numerous, and the defeat of
        such a large army as that of the allies of the Syrian league, and the
        slaughter of a total of 14,000 men among them (another account says
        20,500), many of them in all probability Israelites, finds no place,
        strange to say, in the sacred record, notwithstanding that the Hebrew
        writers do not, as a rule, in the least object to mentioning national
        defeat, and in this case it would have been a most important thing to
        refer to, the danger which threatened them and their allies being
        such as promised to overthrow their national existence altogether.
        Perhaps the compiler of the sacred record, however, did not realize
        to the full what the Assyrian invasion meant; or he may not have
        desired to justify Ahab's policy (which, in view of the danger which
        threatened, was a sound one), and so discredit with the people the
        fanatical behaviour and tragic warning of the prophet who reproached
        the king so mercilessly because he had made friends with Ben-Hadad
        instead of pressing on against him in hostility, even to the
        death.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Rev. Joseph
        Horner (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Proceedings of the Society of Biblical
        Archæology</span></span>, 1898, p. 244), besides bringing in the
        chronological difficulty, which is very real, in spite of Prof.
        Oppert's <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Noli me tangere</span></span> (P.S.B.A.,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page332">[pg 332]</span><a name="Pg332"
        id="Pg332" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> 1898, pp. 24-47), notes (pp.
        237, 238) the difficulty of the name. This is the only place where
        Israel is called in the Assyrian inscriptions Sir´ilâa—in all other
        passages it is <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bît Ḫumrî</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the house of Omri,”</span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mât bît
        Ḫumrî</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the land of the house
        of Omri,”</span> and he regards it as incredible that a name never
        used before, and never afterwards found, should be employed.
        Elsewhere, when speaking of Jehu, Shalmaneser calls him <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“son”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“descendant of
        Omri,”</span> apparently intending thereby to indicate his
        nationality, for, as is well known, the relationship expressed is not
        correct.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nevertheless,
        allowance must be made for the uncertainty attending the introduction
        into the literature of a country of a name with which the people,
        including the scribes, are unfamiliar. Ḫumrî or Omri may have been,
        to the scribe who composed the account given by the Black Obelisk,
        very much easier to remember than the comparatively unfamiliar
        Sir´ilâa, and it may have been felt that the form used was not by any
        means certain—Isra´ilâa would, in fact, have been much better. The
        scribe of the monolith, however, may have inserted what he felt to be
        the Assyro-Babylonian form of the name, for something very similar to
        Sir´ilâa (or Ser´ilâa) exists in the Sar-îli of a contract tablet of
        the reign of Ammi-zaduga, translated in the <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Journal of the Royal
        Asiatic Society</span></span>, 1897, pp. 594-595 (cf. p. 157).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But, as before
        remarked, the chronological difficulty still remains, the date, from
        Hebrew sources, being, according to Prof. Oppert, before 900
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> (the last year of
        Ahab), whilst, according to Assyrian chronology, it should be 853
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> (cf. Sayce in
        Hastings's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Dictionary of the Bible</span></span>, vol. i.
        p. 272).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The importance of
        the city of Hamath is well indicated not only by the above extract,
        but also by the numerous other passages where Irḫulēni (or Urḫilēni)
        of Hamath is referred to. The Guites <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page333">[pg 333]</span><a name="Pg333" id="Pg333" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> were regarded by the late Geo. Smith as the
        Biblical Goim—a rather doubtful identification. As for the Musrites,
        the same scholar thought them to be the Egyptians, Muṣrâa,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Muṣrites,”</span> coming apparently from
        Muṣur, the name of Egypt in the Assyrian inscriptions. Others regard
        them as being a people of the north, and this is more probable,
        though it would perhaps be better to regard the name as unidentified.
        The mention of <span class="tei tei-q">“camels”</span> in connection
        with Gindibu'u of the Arbâa is regarded as stamping the nationality
        referred to as being Arabic, and this is very probable. In Ba'asa son
        of Ruḫubu of the Ammonites we have the comparatively familiar
        Biblical names Baasha and Rehob in their Assyrian forms. It will
        therefore be seen that the extract translated above is of
        considerable interest quite independently of its historical bearings,
        which are of great importance, whatever may be the ultimate opinion
        concerning them.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the next
        three years Shalmaneser was occupied on the west and north-west and
        in Babylonia, so that it was not until 850 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> that he was again able
        to turn his attention to the neighbourhood of Palestine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The clemency of
        Ahab towards Ben-Hadad had apparently ended, as has been seen, in an
        alliance between the two nationalities, but that alliance did not, to
        all appearance, last very long. There is every probability that it
        was an unwilling one on the part of Ben-Hadad, and in all probability
        he took advantage of the death of Ahab to repudiate it. In any case,
        Ben-Hadad is represented in 2 Kings vi. 24 ff., as again besieging
        Samaria, but with disastrous results. What interval there was between
        his raising the siege of Samaria and his death, the sacred narrative
        does not say, but according to Assyrian chronology, there should be
        from four to six years at least (850-846 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>).</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page334">[pg 334]</span><a name="Pg334" id="Pg334"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the tenth year
        of his reign Shalmaneser II. of Assyria crossed the Euphrates for the
        eighth time, and advanced against Sangara of Carchemish, whose cities
        he destroyed, made waste, and burned in the flames. After this came
        the turn of Arame, whose capital city, with one hundred other places
        around it, was laid in ruins. Adad-idri of Damascus (Imēri-šu),
        however, set himself, with Irḫulēni of Hamath, and twelve of the
        kings of Syria, to resist the Assyrian king. Shalmaneser claims to
        have defeated them, put them to flight, and captured their chariots,
        horses, and war-material.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is hardly
        any doubt, however, that his success was not by any means what he
        desired and expected, for he found himself obliged to march again to
        the same region in his eleventh year, when he crossed the Euphrates
        for the ninth time. On this occasion he says that he destroyed
        ninety-seven cities of Sangara of Carchemish and one hundred cities
        of Arame. Having reached the edge of the Ḫamanu (Amanus) range of
        mountains, he traversed the portion named Yaraqu, and descended to
        the land of the Hamathites, where he captured the city Aštamaku and
        ninety-nine other places, defeating their armies with great
        slaughter. Again he met Adad-idri, with Irḫulēni of Hamath and the
        twelve <span class="tei tei-q">“kings of the sea-coast.”</span> In
        the battle which follows he claims to have defeated them and killed
        10,000 of their fighting-men with the sword. He also states that he
        took their chariots, horses, and war-material. On his way back he
        again turned his attention to Arame, capturing his capital Apparazu.
        At that time he likewise received the tribute of Kalparundu of the
        Patinians, consisting of silver, lead, gold, horses, oxen, sheep, and
        textile fabrics. Ascending again into the Amanus mountains, he
        brought away a further supply of cedar-wood for his palaces.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the two
        following years (648 and 647 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page335">[pg 335]</span><a name="Pg335" id="Pg335"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> according to Assyrian reckoning),
        Shalmaneser was not to all appearance engaged in any expeditions of
        importance, or at least their importance is unknown. In his
        fourteenth year, 846 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, however, he crossed
        the Euphrates again, and met Ben-Hadad for the last time. As before,
        the latter was in alliance with Irḫulēni of Hamath and the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“twelve kings of the sea-coast above and
        below.”</span> Again the Assyrian king fought with them and defeated
        them, destroying their chariots and teams, and capturing, as before,
        their war-material, and <span class="tei tei-q">“to save their lives,
        they fled.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally all
        these historical details are of great interest and value. The
        question naturally arises whether, being so much alike in wording and
        results, they may not all refer to the same expedition, which the
        Assyrian king repeated to fill up his annals? As a rule, however, the
        annals of the Assyrian rulers are exceedingly correct, and there is
        consequently but little reason to doubt the accuracy of Shalmaneser's
        statements. It is noteworthy that, in all these descriptions of
        expeditions to the west, twelve kings are mentioned, whilst in the
        first instance eleven only are enumerated, and in the other two the
        twelve are spoken of as if in addition to Adad-idri and Irḫulēni of
        Hamath. Ought we, therefore, to translate <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the twelve kings,”</span> meaning the eleven which are
        referred to along with and including Aḫabbu of the Sir'ilâa, or are
        the twelve kings referred to in the account of the second and third
        encounters with Ben-Hadad merely an indefinite number, meaning
        <span class="tei tei-q">“a dozen,”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“twelve more or less”</span>? As it is impossible that
        Ahab of Israel should have been one of the Syrian league all this
        time, the latter must be held to be the more probable
        explanation—<span class="tei tei-q">“In those days Adad-idri of the
        land of Imēri-šu (and) Irḫulēni of the land of Hamath with a dozen
        kings of the sea-coast trusted each other's might, and came against
        me to make war and battle.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page336">[pg 336]</span><a name="Pg336" id="Pg336" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding
        all his efforts, however, as detailed in his annals, Shalmaneser II.
        was still very far from the subjugation of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“sea-coast,”</span> as he calls Palestine and Syria, and
        realizing that he had a hard task before him, he returned to his own
        country and occupied himself in the two following years in
        Mesopotamia, Ararat, and Namri, south-east of Assyria. The following
        year, 843 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, for the first time
        during his reign, he was at peace, superintending the felling of
        trees in the Amanus mountains for use in the palaces of Assyria. This
        period of rest was in all probability necessary to enable the army to
        be reorganized for further campaigns in that part of the world which
        he seems to have set his heart upon subjugating.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This being the
        case, he set out, in his eighteenth year (842 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>), and crossed the
        Euphrates for the sixteenth time. This expedition, however, was not
        against his old foe, Ben-Hadad or Adad-idri, but against Ḫaza'-îlu,
        the Hazael of 2 Kings viii. 8, etc., who had treacherously murdered
        his master, as related in this passage, and seized the throne.
        Hearing of the advance of the Assyrian army, he prepared for
        resistance, as is related in the following narrative.</p>

        time. Ḫaza-'îlu of the land of Imēri-šu trusted to the might of his
        troops, and called his troops together in great number. Saniru, the
        peak of a mountain which is before Lebanon, he made his stronghold. I
        fought with him, I accomplished his defeat: 16,000 of his
        fighting-men I slew with the sword: 1121 of his chariots, 470 of his
        horses, with his camp, I captured. He fled to save his life—I set out
        after him. I besieged him in Dimašqu (Damascus), his royal city. I
        cut down his orchards; I went to the mountains of the land of Ḫauranu
        (the Hauran), cities without number I destroyed, wasted, and burned
        in the flames. Untold spoil I carried away. I went <span class=

        <span class="tei tei-q">“which is a headland”</span> (lit.,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“head of the sea”</span>)—<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I set up an image of my majesty therein. In those days I
        received the tribute of the Tyrians, Sidonians, (and) of Yaua, son of

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The description of
        this campaign given by the Black Obelisk is as follows—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In my 18th year I crossed the Euphrates for the 16th

        his chariots, 470 of his horses, with his camp, I took away from
        him.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These two
        documents, as will easily be seen, are in perfect accord, and the
        story they have to tell agrees in its turn with that of the preceding
        years of Shalmaneser's reign. Indeed, this text may be regarded as
        confirming the opinions hitherto held concerning the identity of
        Aḫabbu mât Sir'ilâa with Ahab of Israel, and Adad-idri with Ben-Hadad
        of Damascus. This, be it noted, is due to the fact that, like
        Ben-Hadad, Adad-idri was succeeded by Hazael, who, in both the Bible
        narrative and the annals of Shalmaneser, is a contemporary of Jehu
        (Yaua, son of Ḫumrî or Omri). The Black Obelisk, probably for the
        sake of economizing space, does not refer to the receipt of tribute
        from Jehu when speaking of the battle with Hazael, on account of the
        bas-relief thereon referring to that event. The following is the
        translation of the epigraph in question which I gave in 1886<a id=
        "noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The tribute of Yaua, son of Ḫumrî: silver, gold, a
        golden cup, golden vases, golden vessels, golden buckets, lead, a

        received.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The account of the
        conflict with Hazael indicates that certain changes had taken place
        in the Mediterranean <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page338">[pg
        338]</span><a name="Pg338" id="Pg338" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        coast-lands since Shalmaneser's former campaigns thither. It was no
        longer against the kings of Damascus and Hamath with <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“a dozen kings”</span> in alliance with them, but against
        Hazael alone. Had they broken with Ben-Hadad? or did they hold aloof
        because they had no sympathy with his murderer? In any case, it would
        seem to be certain that they no longer feared the Assyrian king, who,
        they must have felt, had his hands full. In Israel, too, there had
        been changes, Ahab having been succeeded by Ahaziah, who, after a
        reign of one year, was succeeded by Jehoram. The latter tried to
        reduce Mesha king of Moab again to subjection, but without success.
        Ben-Hadad's attempt to capture Samaria was made during his reign, and
        the non-success of the Syrian king was probably the cause of
        Jehoram's attempt to recover Ramoth-gilead, where Ahab had found his
        fate some years before. The king of Israel did not fall on the field
        of battle, but received there a wound which obliged him to return to
        Jezreel. His death at the hands of Jehu in Naboth's vineyard is one
        of the most dramatic incidents of Israelitish history.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Jehu's payment of
        tribute to the Assyrian king in 842 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> was probably due to a
        question of policy, and in the main it may be considered as a cheap
        way of avoiding misfortune, for he might easily have been worsted in
        an encounter with Shalmaneser. What Tyre and Sidon thought fit to do,
        could hardly but be recognized as policy for Israel as well. It was
        important for Jehu that he should consolidate his power, hence this
        submission, though, to say the truth, he could not have been certain
        that he would be attacked. Was it that he felt strong enough to
        resist the Assyrian king which made him withhold the payment of
        tribute when, in 839 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, Shalmaneser again
        marched against Hazael? It would seem so. On this occasion four towns
        of the king of Damascus <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page339">[pg
        339]</span><a name="Pg339" id="Pg339" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        were captured, and tribute again received from Tyre and Sidon, Gebal
        likewise buying peace in the same way.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That Jehu, who
        destroyed the house of Omri, should be called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“son of Omri”</span> in the inscriptions of Shalmaneser
        II. of Assyria, is strange, and needs explanation. Perhaps the
        successor of a king could loosely be spoken of as his son, as
        occupying the place of such a relative; and, as is well known,
        Belshazzar, in the book of Daniel, is called son of Nebuchadnezzar,
        which, according to the Babylonian inscriptions, he certainly was
        not. That Jehu may have been in some way related with Jehoram, and
        therefore a descendant of Omri, is possible and even probable. That
        he was not descended from him in a direct line is certain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is noteworthy
        that the Assyrian form of the name, Yaua, shows that the unpronounced
        aleph at the end was at that time sounded, so that the Hebrews must
        have called him Yahua (Jehua). Omri was likewise pronounced in
        accordance with the older system, before the ghain became ayin. Ḫumrî
        shows that they said at that time Ghomrî.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After the
        rebellion which embittered the closing years of Shalmaneser's life,
        the great Assyrian king died, and his crown went to his younger son
        Šamši-Adad III. (825-812 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>). The first work of the
        new ruler was the pacification of his country, and this having been
        successfully done, he tried to restore Assyrian influence beyond the
        borders of his kingdom. During his reign of about thirteen years, he
        warred on the N., N.E., N.W. and S. (Babylonia), but never came
        nearer to Syria than Kar-Shalmaneser on the Euphrates, near
        Carchemish.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His son,
        Adad-nirari, who reigned from 812 to 783 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, followed in his
        footsteps, and began by making conquests on the east. The north and
        north-west, however, also felt the force of his arms. The
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page340">[pg 340]</span><a name="Pg340"
        id="Pg340" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> only campaign of which details
        are given is one against Syria, the date of which, however, is not
        known. G. Smith thought that this could not have taken place earlier
        than 797 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, during the time of
        Amaziah king of Judah and Joash king of Israel—a conjecture which is
        based, to all appearance, upon the comparison of Mansuate with
        Manasseh. As the Assyrian form of this name is Minsē or Minasē, such
        an identification is impossible, and this being the case, it is more
        probable that the expeditions to the Holy Land and Syria took place
        either in 806, when he went to Arpad, 805, when he was at Ḫaza, or
        804, when he marched against Ba'ali, the name, apparently, of a
        Phœnician city. The next year he went to the sea-coast, but whether
        this was the Mediterranean or not is not indicated, though it may be
        regarded as very probable, and if so, 803 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> must be added to the
        dates already named, or the operations to which he refers in his
        slab-inscription may have extended over one or more of the years here
        referred to.</p>

        (Damascus), his royal city. The fear and terror of Aššur, his lord,
        struck him, and he took my feet, performed homage. Two thousand three
        hundred talents of silver, 20 talents of gold, 3000 talents of
        bronze, 5000 talents of iron, cloth, variegated stuffs, linen, a
        couch of ivory, an inlaid litter of ivory, (with) cushions (?), his
        goods, his property, to a countless amount I received in Damascus,
        his royal city, in the midst of his palace. All the kings of the land
        of Kaldu (the Chaldean tribes in Babylonia) performed homage, tax and
        tribute for future days I fixed upon them. Babylon, Borsippa, Cuthah,
        brought the overplus (of the treasures) of Bêl, Nebo, (and) Nergal,
        (made) pure offerings....”</span></p>

        against Syria to have taken place in 803 <span class=

        deliverer sent by Yahwah in answer to the prayers of Jehoahaz.
        According to 2 Kings xiii. 3, the Israelites were subject to Hazael
        and Ben-Hadad, his son, all their days. There is every probability
        that the successor of the latter was the Mari'u mentioned in the
        translation given above, and the same inscription would seem to
        indicate that the Israelites submitted to the Assyrian king, and paid
        him tribute in order to secure his intervention, which, judging from
        the enormous amount of spoil which he secured, he did not regret. The
        saviour having come, and the tribute paid, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Israel dwelt in their tents, as beforetime”</span> (2
        Kings xiii. 5). Verses 22-25 are to all appearance a recapitulation,
        probably extracted from another source. They show that Joash, son of
        Jehoahaz, rebelled, and took from Ben-Hadad the cities which the
        last-named had captured from Israel, and defeated him three times
        (see ver. 19). Apparently <span class="tei tei-q">“all their
        days”</span> in ver. 3 is not to be taken literally, as the war of
        the Israelites against Syria took place before the death of Ben-Hadad
        III. It may also be conjectured that the reason of there being no
        more than three defeats of the Syrians was due to the death of
        Ben-Hadad, and his sceptre passing into younger and more vigorous
        hands, so that <span class="tei tei-q">“a saviour”</span> was still
        needed, and found in the person of the Assyrian king, as suggested by
        Schrader. The Syrian forces not being in a condition, after their
        defeats by the Israelites, to offer battle to Adad-nirari, apparently
        submitted without fighting, and after such a visit the country had
        too much need for peace to allow of reprisals being made against the
        Israelites.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fame of
        Adad-nirari was great, and his queen seems to have shared in it. She
        was named Sammu-ramat, <span class="tei tei-q">“(the goddess) Sammu
        loveth (her),”</span> a name which is generally regarded as the
        original of the somewhat mythical Semiramis of Herodotus. That she
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page343">[pg 343]</span><a name="Pg343"
        id="Pg343" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> was looked up to by the
        subjects of her royal spouse, however, is proved by the two statues
        in the British Museum (there were in all four of them, erected at
        Calah). According to the inscription on them, they were made and
        dedicated for one of the chief officers of the kingdom,
        Bêl-tarṣi-îli-ma (<span class="tei tei-q">“a lord before
        God”</span>), who furnished them with the following dedication—</p>

        beloved of Ea, lord of lords, whose power hath no equal, without whom
        there would be no counsel in heaven; the gracious one, pitiful, whose
        sympathy is good; he who dwelleth in E-zida, which is within

        the land of Aššur, his lord, and the life of Sammu-ramat, she of the

        Yaluna, for the saving of his life, the lengthening of his days, the
        adding of days to his years, the peace of his house and his people
        (not the one evil to him), he has caused (this statue) to be made as
        a gift. Whoever (cometh) after: Trust to Nebo—trust not another
        god.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is rare that an
        Assyrian queen is mentioned in the inscriptions, especially on almost
        equal terms with the king, and additional interest is added by the
        fact, that she bears a name commonly regarded as the <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page344">[pg 344]</span><a name="Pg344" id="Pg344"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> same as that of Semiramis. In Assyrian
        and Babylonian history, it is always the king who is the ruler,
        whatever influence his spouse may have had in determining his policy
        as such being always unmentioned, and therefore unknown to the world
        at large. The present inscription, however, seems to testify that
        Sammu-ramat was known outside the walls of the palace, and that one
        of the greatest in the kingdom thought fit to do her honour by
        associating her with the king in the dedication to Nebo which he made
        for the preservation of the lives of the king, the queen, and
        himself. Whether the history of Sammu-ramat, queen of Assyria, was
        laid under contribution to furnish details for the legend of
        Semiramis, will probably never be known; but it is nevertheless
        unfortunate that the slab recounting the warlike exploits of
        Adad-nirari, king of Assyria, her husband, should break off in the
        middle of his account of his successes in Babylonia.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Adad-nirari
        reigned 29 years, and was succeeded by Shalmaneser III. in 783
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> The expeditions of this
        king were principally against Armenia and Itu'u, a region on the
        Euphrates. In the year 775 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> he went to the
        cedar-country, but whether the mountain region of the Amanus,
        Lebanon, or of a district called Ḫašur be intended, is unknown. The
        necessity of expeditions against Syria, however, still continued, for
        in 773 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> we find Shalmaneser at
        Damascus, probably to bring the king then ruling there again into
        subjection.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Although doubt is
        now expressed as to whether Ḫatarika, whither Shalmaneser III.
        marched in 772 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, the last year of his
        reign, be really Hadrach (Zech. ix. 1) or not (the consonants do not
        agree so well as they ought to do), in all probability it was a
        district not far from Damascus to which he went.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Aššur-dan, his
        successor, ascended the throne in the following year, and at once
        began warring in <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page345">[pg
        345]</span><a name="Pg345" id="Pg345" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Babylonia and on the east. In 765 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> he marched to Ḫatarika.
        Signs of revolt seem at this time to have broken out in Assyria,
        probably on account of the pestilence with which the land was
        afflicted, and it must have been for this reason that no expedition
        was undertaken in the year 764 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> Next year the rising,
        which was evidently expected, took place in the city of Aššur, and
        there was an eclipse of the sun in the month Sivan, an important
        astronomical occurrence which has been identified with an eclipse
        which passed over Assyria on the 15th of June, 763 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, and was supposed by
        Mr. Bosanquet to be referred to in Amos viii. 9, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and will darken
        the earth in the clear day.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all appearance
        this eclipse, taken in conjunction with the presence of pestilence
        and rebellion, was regarded as an evil omen. This revolt lasted into
        the next year, and spread, in 761 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, into Arrapḫa, where it
        continued three years. In 759 the revolt reached Gozan, and there was
        a recrudescence of the plague. There is no reference to the stamping
        out of the revolt in Assyria, but it seems very probable that the
        king and his supporters were active to that end, as he was able to
        march in the year 758 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, to Gozan, after which
        there is the entry, <span class="tei tei-q">“Peace in the
        land.”</span> Two years were to all appearance occupied in
        reorganizing the country and providing against a repetition of such
        risings, unless it be that Aššur-dan was too ill to take the field,
        for according to the received chronology, he died in 755 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> when Aššur-nirari II.
        ascended the throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This new ruler is
        represented to have made two expeditions, one in the year of his
        accession, to Ḫatarika, and the other, in 754 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, to Arpad. What the
        additional statement, <span class="tei tei-q">“Return from the city
        of Aššur,”</span> really refers to, is exceedingly doubtful—perhaps
        troops had been stationed there during the <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page346">[pg 346]</span><a name="Pg346" id="Pg346" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> whole period since the breaking out of the
        revolt there in 763 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For four years no
        expeditions were made, pointing to a continued ferment of discontent
        in Assyria. In 749 and 748 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, however, Aššur-nirari
        made expeditions to Namri, south-west of Media. It is significant,
        however, that the Canon has, for the next year (747 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>), the usual words
        (<span class="tei tei-q">“In the land”</span>) when no expedition
        took place, the reason probably being the unsettled state of the
        country. The entry for the next year is <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Revolt in Calah,”</span> which, as has already been
        seen, was one of the principal cities of the kingdom. After this is
        the usual division-line, indicating the end of a reign, followed by
        the words <span class="tei tei-q">“(Eponymy of Nabû-bêl-uṣur,
        governor of) Arrapḫa. In the month Aaru (Iyyar), day 13,
        Tiglath-pileser sat upon the throne. In the month Tisritu (Tisri) he
        made an expedition to (the district) between the rivers.”</span> This
        corresponds with 745 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus is ushered
        in, in the Eponym Canon, one of the most important reigns in Assyrian
        history. By what right Tiglath-pileser III. took the throne is not
        known. To all appearance, he was not in any way related to his
        predecessor, Aššur-nirari, and it is therefore supposed that he was
        one of the generals of that king, who, taking advantage of the rising
        in Aššur (of which he may, indeed, have been the instigator), made
        away with his sovereign, and set himself in his place. Further light,
        however, is needed upon this period, before anything can be said as
        to the circumstances attending Tiglath-pileser's accession to the
        throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though all
        Tiglath-pileser's inscriptions are imperfect, and most of them very
        fragmentary, they nevertheless contain enough to show of what
        enormous value they are. Their incompleteness and the absence of
        dates consequent thereon is fortunately compensated somewhat by the
        fact that the Eponym Canon is perfect in the part which refers to
        this king, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page347">[pg
        347]</span><a name="Pg347" id="Pg347" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and
        that we are therefore able to locate with certainty all the events of
        his reign.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the entry
        translated above shows, his first campaign was <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“between the rivers,”</span> that is, to Babylonia, the
        land lying between the Tigris and the Euphrates. His object in
        leading his forces thither was to break the power of the Aramean
        tribes, with the Arabs and others who were in alliance with them.
        Going first south-east, he subjugated the Chaldean tribes, including
        the Pekodites; turning afterwards west, he went against the Arameans,
        capturing Sippar, Dûr-Kuri-galzu, and other Babylonian cities, and it
        is supposed that it was on this occasion that he assumed the title
        <span class="tei tei-q">“king of Šumer and Akkad.”</span> To all
        appearance, however, he was not recognized by the Babylonians
        themselves as king, Nabonassar being then on the throne. There is
        hardly any doubt, however, that Babylonia acknowledged Assyrian
        overlordship on this occasion, thus giving Tiglath-pileser some
        justification for assuming the title.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Having arranged
        things to his satisfaction in Babylonia, Tiglath-pileser turned his
        attention to the East (Namri, 744), Ararat (743), and Arpad (same
        year), the last being his objective up to and including the year 740
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> Sardurri of Ararat,
        however, saw his influence threatened by this move, for he, too, was
        a conqueror, and had had such success, that he felt justified in
        calling himself <span class="tei tei-q">“king of Suri,”</span> or
        North Syria. How matters fell out is not known, but it may be
        supposed that the Assyrian king went and besieged Arpad, was attacked
        whilst doing so by Sardurri and his allies, and compelled to raise
        the siege. A pursuit of the Armenian forces by the Assyrians was the
        result of this attack, the end being, in all probability, a decisive
        victory for Tiglath-pileser. This, according to Rost, would seem to
        be the most reasonable supposition, for the Assyrian king was able to
        besiege Arpad again next year without any hindrance. <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page348">[pg 348]</span><a name="Pg348" id="Pg348"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> The capture of the city in the third year
        brought the rulers of the district in which it stood to the feet of
        the Assyrian king—all except one, Tutamû king of Unqu, who was
        defeated and captured, and his territories annexed to Assyria.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the
        campaigns in the north at the end of 739 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, risings took place in
        Syria and North Phœnicia, and this gave Tiglath-pileser the
        wished-for opportunity to bring these districts again under his sway.
        The Eponym Canon gives for this year the simple entry, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“He captured the city of Kullanû,”</span> which Rost
        supposes to have been in the neighbourhood of Hamath, and if so, must
        be the Calne of Isaiah x. 9, which is there mentioned with Hamath,
        Carchemish, Arpad, Samaria, and Damascus as having been subdued by
        Assyria. The mention of Kullanû as the object of the expedition is
        probably due to its having been one of the chief factors in the
        disturbances which took place. It would also seem that Azariah of
        Judah took part in the attempt to get rid of Assyrian influence, and
        though this was fully recognized by Tiglath-pileser, the Assyrian
        king to all appearance did not come into direct contact with his
        country.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Azriau or Izriau
        (Azariah—Rost's collation of the squeezes shows that both spellings
        of the name were used) of Judah is mentioned at least four times. The
        earlier references, however, are so very fragmentary that nothing
        certain can be said concerning their connection—in one of the
        passages containing his name the wording leads one to imagine that he
        was captured by the Assyrian king, though, as Rost has shown, this
        may simply mean that certain sympathizers of his had taken his part.
        But whatever may have taken place in Judah, Azariah's sympathizers
        did not get on so well as their leader. No less than nineteen places
        were captured by the Assyrian king, including <span class=

        with the cities which were around them, of the sea-coast of the
        setting of the sun, which in sin and wickedness had taken to Azriau,
        I added to the boundary of Assyria. I set my commander-in-chief as
        governor over them, 30,300 people I removed from the midst of their
        cities and caused the province of the city of Ku- ... to take
        them.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding
        that there is no reference to the above in the Old Testament, there
        is no reason to doubt that it is substantially correct. Its omission
        is in all probability due to the fact, that neither Judah nor Israel
        were menaced by the forces of the Assyrian king. Notwithstanding
        this, the expedition and the success of Tiglath-pileser had its
        effect, the result being that all the princes of middle and north
        Syria showed their submission to the Assyrian king by paying tribute,
        thus ensuring the safety of their territory, at least for a time.
        This took place after the defeat of Kišî, the Aramean, and his
        forces, together with several other districts, and the transportation
        of the inhabitants from their homes to districts in other
        principalities, a proceeding calculated to destroy national feeling
        and thus contribute to the safety of <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        unlikely. The following is the list of the princes who secured
        immunity from attack by paying tribute:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was a rich
        booty, and was probably held to be a sufficient return for all the
        expense, and trials, and hardships of the campaign. Though the
        kingdom of Judah seems not to have suffered (we must not be too hasty
        to assume that this was the case, as the Assyrian records are
        exceedingly defective), Israel, as is mentioned above, paid tribute.
        It does not appear from the Assyrian account that Tiglath-pileser
        went against Samaria, but notwithstanding this, 2 Kings xv. 19 has
        the following—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“There came against the land Pul the king of Assyria; and
        Menahem gave Pul 1000 talents of silver, that his hand might be with
        him to confirm the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page351">[pg
        351]</span><a name="Pg351" id="Pg351" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        kingdom in his hand. And Menahem exacted the money of Israel, even of
        all the mighty men of wealth, of each man fifty shekels of silver, to
        give to the king of Assyria. So the king of Assyria turned back, and
        stayed not there in the land.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is to be noted
        that there is here nothing about buying the Assyrian king off—the
        money was paid him to confirm the kingdom in Menahem's hand. The
        writer apparently assumed that the Assyrian king might not altogether
        be hostilely inclined, notwithstanding that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“he came against the land.”</span> Perhaps by
        <span class="tei tei-q">“land”</span> we are to understand
        <span class="tei tei-q">“district.”</span> In any case, the two
        accounts can hardly be said to disagree. He did not war there, but he
        received Menahem's tribute—it was therefore needless to mention his
        visit, if such it was. Many a ruler in this district must have done
        the same thing on this occasion, and there could have been no reason
        to mention one more than the other—hence, probably, the absence of
        references to any threatening approach to the borders of Israel and
        other states on the part of the Assyrian king.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But whilst absent
        in the west, rebellion was rife nearer home, and was put down with
        vigour by the governors of the provinces of Lullumû and Na'iru
        (Mesopotamia). This led to further transportations of the
        inhabitants, who were sent west to Ṣimirra (Simyra), Arka, Usnu,
        Siannu, Tu'immu, and other places in Syria. Next year Tiglath-pileser
        himself marched to Madâa (the Medes), where he had a very successful
        campaign. As some of the places mentioned have the element Kingi as
        part of the name, it has been suggested that in all probability the
        Sumerians, whose Babylonian home was called Kingi, had their original
        seat in Media.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Campaigns against
        the district of the mountains of Nal and Ararat, the former as a
        preparation for the latter, follow, after which comes, according to
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page352">[pg 352]</span><a name=
        "Pg352" id="Pg352" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Eponym Canon, an
        expedition to the land Pilišta. This is set down as the event of 734
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> There is, it is
        needless to say, some uncertainty in this expression, as the question
        naturally arises, What is really included in the term? Assuming, with
        Rost, that the statements in the Canon indicate the point intended to
        be reached, and not the farthest point attained, it is very probable
        that Israel did not come into the sphere of the Assyrian king's
        operations, and this is all the more probable in that Rost's
        collation of one of the squeezes in the British Museum shows that
        instead of the Assyrian form of Abel-Beth-Maachah, we have to read
        Abil-akka, to which is added, however, the description <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“on the boundary of Israel (Bît-Ḫumria).”</span> It will
        be seen, therefore, that though he may not have entered the country,
        or, at least, made any warlike operations there, he approached well
        within striking distance of its borders. On this occasion it would
        seem that he found it necessary to install six new governors so as to
        ensure the due obedience of the inhabitants. After this,
        Tiglath-pileser goes on to speak of Hanon of Gaza, who on seeing the
        approach of the Assyrians fled to Egypt, leaving his capital at the
        mercy of the invader. Having captured the city, Tiglath-pileser
        entered Hanon's royal palace, taking possession of all his property,
        and setting therein his royal couch. He speaks of having delivered
        something to the gods of the land, and of having laid upon its
        inhabitants (the payment of tribute and gifts). Further mutilated
        lines follow, referring to the spoil taken, and there is a reference
        to the land of Israel (mât Bît-Ḫumria). After this comes the words,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the whole of his people, (with their
        property) I sent to Assyria.”</span> The gap between the reference to
        Israel and this line, however, makes it doubtful to what it really
        refers. The record immediately goes on, however, to speak of the
        death of Pekah.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page353">[pg
        353]</span><a name="Pg353" id="Pg353" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the Eponym
        Canon the entries for the two years following the campaign to Pilišta
        (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> 733-732 <span class=

        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>) are, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“to the land of Dimašqa.”</span> It would therefore seem
        that, having assured himself of the submission of his north-Phœnician
        vassals, Tiglath-pileser attacked the northern district of Israel,
        taking Ijon, Abel-beth-maachah, Janoah, Kedesh, Hazor, Gilead,
        Galilee, and all the land of Naphtali (2 Kings xv. 29). No account of
        this, however, occurs in the Assyrian inscriptions,<a id="noteref_93"
        name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a> which,
        as already pointed out, are very mutilated for this period. It is
        possible that the reference to Israel, in the mutilated passage
        quoted above, relates to this invasion, and possibly also to the
        payment of tribute by Pekah in order to secure himself against
        further attacks.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether before or
        after the above is not known, but possibly on the departure of the
        Assyrians, Rezin (Rezon), king of Syria, made alliance with Pekah,
        and their combined forces invaded Judah. Ahaz, who was at this time
        king of Judah, was apparently besieged in Jerusalem, and the king of
        Syria took advantage of this opportunity to recover possession of
        Elath, which never fell into the hands of the Jews again (2 Kings
        xvi. 6).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is no doubt
        that Ahaz was hard pressed, and hearing, to all appearance, that the
        Assyrians were again in the neighbourhood, he sent to Tiglath-pileser
        a humble message: <span class="tei tei-q">“I am thy servant, and thy
        son; come up, and save me out of the hand of the king of Syria, and
        out of the hand of the king of Israel, which rise up against
        me.”</span> This would in all probability have had but little effect,
        had it not been accompanied by a goodly amount of gold and silver,
        taken not only from his own treasury, but also from that of the
        Temple at Jerusalem. The result was, that Tiglath-pileser
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page354">[pg 354]</span><a name="Pg354"
        id="Pg354" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> went up against Damascus. The
        Syrian king, however, decided to resist, and a battle was fought in
        which he was defeated, and obliged to seek safety in flight. With a
        grim, not to say barbarous, humour, Tiglath-pileser describes his
        flight and the treatment of his supporters—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“... (like) a mouse he entered the great gate of his

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This is
        immediately followed by an account of the operations against Samsi,
        queen of Arabia, and the tribes connected with that over which she
        held sway. After this he states that he set Idi-bi'ilu as governor
        over the land of Musru. All these passages, however, are exceedingly
        incomplete, as is also that referring to Samaria, which follows. The
        shorter account of the expeditions of Tiglath-pileser gives in this
        place lines of which the following is a translation—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The longer
        account, from which most of the above extracts have been made, may
        therefore be completed, with Rost, provisionally, as follows—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“(Pekah, all of whose) cities (I had captured) in my

        (Pekah), their king, (they overthrew, and like) a hurricane (I
        ravaged the land).”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As will be seen,
        the above agrees closely with the statement in 2 Kings xv. 30—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“And Hoshea the son of Elah made a conspiracy against
        Pekah the son of Remaliah, and smote him, and slew him, and reigned

        Uzziah.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Mutilated details
        concerning other cities captured by Tiglath-pileser follow the above
        extract from his annals, after which the narrative continues—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“(Mitinti, of the land) of the Askelonites, (sinned)
        against (my) agreement, (and revolted against me). He saw (the

        upon him (?), and Rûkipti, the son of Mitinti), sat upon the
        throne....”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the account of
        the flight and death of Pekah, the Assyrian king suggests that the
        abandonment of the king of Israel of his capital was due to the fear
        of capture at his hands. One may also suppose that he wished it to be
        understood that Pekah incurred the displeasure of his subjects by his
        flight, and that they pursued after him, and having overtaken him,
        put him to death. As a matter of fact, Pekah must really have fled on
        account of the rebellion led by Hoshea, who, on learning of his
        flight, in all probability pursued after him, and thus encompassed
        his death. Hoshea then, by a payment of tribute to Tiglath-pileser,
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page356">[pg 356]</span><a name="Pg356"
        id="Pg356" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> secured from the Assyrian king
        his recognition as king of Israel, and at the same time assured
        himself against attack at his hands.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Imitating Hoshea,
        Rûkipti, the new king of Askelon, also paid tribute, and thus secured
        his recognition. As to Rezon, the Assyrian text does not enable us to
        see what was his ultimate fate, but as it was such, apparently, as to
        terrify Mitinti of Askelon into madness, it may be supposed that it
        was death at the orders of the Assyrian king, as recorded in 2 Kings
        xvi. 9.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Tiglath-pileser
        was now complete master of the land of Ša-imēri-šu or Syria, and all
        the princes of the west acknowledged his overlordship. This being the
        case, it is only natural that Ahaz of Judah should visit and pay him
        homage at Damascus, the capital of the new province, as related in 2
        Kings xvi. 10, and probably it was to that city that many of the
        other subject princes went for that purpose, and to offer him their
        tribute. The further result of the visit of Ahaz is detailed in the
        succeeding verses of the passage in 2 Kings referred to.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus ended
        Tiglath-pileser's successful expedition to Pilišta and Damascus, and
        there is no record that he ever went westward again. The Chaldeans,
        in combination with the Arameans, had made use of his absence to
        engage in new advances against Babylon. Nabonassar, the king of that
        country, had died, and been succeeded by his son, Nabû-nadin-zēri,
        who, however, only reigned two years, and gave place to
        Nabû-šum-ukîn, who murdered him. This last, however, only held the
        throne for somewhat more than two months, and Ukîn-zēr, chief of the
        Chaldean tribe Bît-Amukkāni, took possession of the throne, and ruled
        for three years—much against the inclination of the Babylonians, who,
        to all appearance, had no love for the Chaldean tribes inhabiting
        certain tracts of the country. The interference of Tiglath-pileser
        was therefore looked on with favour by the Babylonians, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page357">[pg 357]</span><a name="Pg357" id="Pg357"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> who welcomed him as a deliverer. Ukîn-zēr
        (the Chinzēros of Ptolemy) was besieged in his capital, Sapîa, though
        that city was not taken until the year 729 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> The result of this was,
        the submission of all the Chaldean tribes, including that of which
        Merodach-baladan (then only a young man) was the chief. Entering
        Babylon, Tiglath-pileser, in accordance with the custom, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“took the hand of Bêl,”</span> an expression apparently
        meaning that he performed the usual ceremonies, and was accepted by
        the god—and the priesthood—as king. This also took place again next
        year, from which it may be supposed that one acknowledged as king of
        Babylon had to perform the ceremony yearly in order to fulfil the
        conditions imposed upon all who held the reins of power. An entry in
        the Canon for this year suggests that there was a rebellion (?) in a
        city of which only the first character is preserved—possibly to be
        completed Dir, and perhaps situated in Babylonia. Operations against
        this place, in all probability, were taken in hand next year (727
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>), but whilst they were
        in progress, Tiglath-pileser died, and Shalmaneser IV. mounted the
        throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How it is that
        Tiglath-pileser III. of Assyria was called Pûlu is not known. The
        name only occurs, in native documents, in the Babylonian Canon of
        kings—to all appearance that from which the Canon of Ptolemy was
        copied. It is therefore practically certain that he only bore this
        name officially in Babylonia. Probably the most likely explanation
        is, that it was his original name, though it may have been given him
        by the compiler of the canon (supposing that he was a man who had no
        great admiration for the Assyrian conqueror) as a scornful
        expression, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        "font-style: italic">pûlu</span></span>) meaning <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the wild animal.”</span> It occurs, however, as a
        personal name in the inscriptions of Assyria at least twice, the
        bearer of it being in one case a charioteer, one of nine officials of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Ḫuḫamite.”</span></p><span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact that the
        name Pûlu (in the Canon of Ptolemy Poros), applied to
        Tiglath-pileser, occurs only in a Babylonian document, suggests that
        the reference to the Assyrian conqueror in 2 Kings xv. 19 and 1
        Chron. v. 26 are due to a Babylonian source, though, as it is the
        name by which he is at first called by the writer of the 2nd Book of
        Kings, this is a confirmation of the explanation that it was his
        original name. The glory attached to the name Tiglath-pileser in
        Assyrian history probably accounts for his having ultimately adopted
        the latter.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These two extracts
        give practically all that is known of the important reign of
        Shalmaneser IV. from native sources. The first is from the Babylonian
        Chronicle, and its brevity in all likelihood indicates the amount of
        sympathy that the Babylonians had for this king. Short as it is,
        however, it is probably of as much value historically as the Assyrian
        Eponym Canon in its present state, even including the restorations
        from that without historical notices. The completion of this
        important document from additional fragments and duplicates is
        greatly to be wished.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page359">[pg
        359]</span><a name="Pg359" id="Pg359" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is therefore
        from the Old Testament and Josephus that we get the fullest history
        of the reign of this king. How it is that no records have been found
        is not known. They may have been destroyed, or nothing very extensive
        may have been written. That at least something of the kind existed is
        indicated by the fact that the late George Smith refers to at least
        one document, the whereabouts of which at present is not known.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What may have been
        the relationship of Shalmaneser IV. of Assyria to Tiglath-pileser
        does not appear. There is every probability that, like his great
        predecessor, he was an adventurer who, taking advantage of his
        popularity with the army, and the failing powers of his royal master,
        seized the throne. As will be seen from the Eponym Canon, an
        expedition was in progress when he assumed the reins of power, so
        that he may have taken advantage of the absence of Tiglath-pileser to
        carry out his design. Tebet being the tenth month of the
        Assyro-Babylonian year, the time of his accession corresponds with
        the winter of 727 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, a period at which
        warlike operations were impossible. In the year 726 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> also he remained at
        home, as was to be expected, consolidating his power.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His first campaign
        must therefore have taken place in 725 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, when, as recorded in 2
        Kings xvii. 3, he went against Hoshea, who paid him homage and became
        tributary. Hearing that the king of Israel had sent privately to
        So,<a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a> king of
        Egypt, asking for his help against the Assyrian king, Shalmaneser
        threw Hoshea into prison, and advancing against Samaria, called upon
        the city to surrender. Submission being refused, he laid siege
        against it, and although Josephus relates that he ultimately took it,
        this must be due simply to an inference, as there is no statement to
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page360">[pg 360]</span><a name="Pg360"
        id="Pg360" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> that effect in the Book of
        Kings, the words recording the event being simply <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the king of Assyria took Samaria,”</span> and, as we
        know from the inscriptions, it is Sargon, successor of Shalmaneser,
        who claims the honour of capturing the city (see below, p. <a href=
        "#Pg363" class="tei tei-ref">363</a>).<a id="noteref_96" name=
        "noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">During the siege,
        however, the Assyrian king busied himself with the subjugation of all
        the surrounding district. It was probably in the same year (725
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>) that he sent his army
        against Elulaeus, king of Tyre, whose king had just been very
        successful in subjugating the Cittaeans (people of Cyprus). According
        to Josephus (or, rather, Menander, whom he quotes), Phœnicia
        submitted (Menander tells the story from the native point of view,
        and states that <span class="tei tei-q">“he soon made peace with them
        all”</span>), but Sidon, Accho, and Old Tyre (Palaetyrus) revolted
        (this probably means <span class="tei tei-q">“joined the
        Assyrians”</span>), and several other cities yielded to the king of
        Assyria. Finding that the Tyrians<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97"
        href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a> would
        not submit, the Assyrian king returned against them (this must have
        been in the year 724 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>), and attacked them
        again, being aided on this occasion by the Phœnicians, who furnished
        him with threescore ships, and 800 men to row them. The attack of the
        Assyrian allies, however, must have been a very half-hearted one, for
        the Tyrians advanced against them with only twelve ships, and
        dispersed those of the enemy, taking 500 men prisoners.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reputation—and
        also the confidence—of the citizens of Tyre being thus greatly
        increased, they continued their resistance, and Shalmaneser found
        himself obliged, in consequence of the inefficiency of his allies, to
        content himself with a mere blockade of the city, and the placing of
        guards over the water supply, so as to reduce the inhabitants of Tyre
        by <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page361">[pg 361]</span><a name=
        "Pg361" id="Pg361" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> thirst. The latter,
        however, dug wells, and were thus enabled to continue their
        resistance, which Meander states lasted all the time of the siege,
        namely, five years—<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> until two years after the
        death of Shalmaneser.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all appearance
        the Sabara'in of the Babylonian Chronicle is the place which should
        be supplied in the historical Eponym Canon, but, if so, the form is a
        strange one. One would rather expect mât Bît-Ḫumrî, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the land of Beth-Omri,”</span> Pilišta, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Philistia,”</span> or âl Ṣurri, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the city of Tyre.”</span> There is also the possibility
        that one of these names may have appeared in each of the three lines
        which require completing, indicating three different stages of his
        conquests. Samerina, <span class="tei tei-q">“Samaria,”</span> may
        also have been the word, or one of the words, to be restored. In this
        last case, Delitzsch's suggestion that Sabara'in ought to be read
        Samara'in, and regarded as the Babylonian form of the Heb. Shomeron,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Samaria,”</span> is worthy of note. The
        Babylonians do not state that he captured Sabara'in or Samara'in, but
        only that he destroyed (perhaps the word means <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“ravaged”</span>) it, and the city may not have really
        fallen into the hands of the Assyrians until Sargon was actually on
        the throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“In the 5th year Šulmanu-ašarid died in the month Tebet.
        Šulmanu-ašarid had ruled the kingdom of Akkad and Aššur for five
        years. In the month Tebet, the 12th day, Sargon sat on the throne in
        Aššur, and in the month Nisan Marduk-âbla-iddina (Merodach-baladan)
        sat on the throne in Babylon.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Thus does the
        Babylonian Chronicle record the change of rulers, which was to have
        wide-reaching results for both countries.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What the verse in
        Hoshea, <span class="tei tei-q">“All thy fortresses shall be spoiled,
        as Shalman spoiled Beth-arbel in the day of battle,”</span> refers
        to, is not known. There is every probability that Shalman stands for
        Shalmaneser IV., but which is the Beth-arbel which is spoken of?
        There were two places of the name in Palestine, one <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page362">[pg 362]</span><a name="Pg362" id="Pg362"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> west of the Sea of Galilee, and the other
        at the extreme north of Gilead. Both are now called Irbid. If it be
        one of these, the verse probably refers to some incident of
        Shalmaneser's invasion. George Smith, however, thought that the
        reference may have been due to some domestic strife in Assyria at the
        close of the reign of Shalmaneser, in which the Assyrian city of
        Arbela was involved. That it was one of the two places in Palestine,
        however, is more probable.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The month which,
        five years earlier, had seen the death of Tiglath-pileser, saw the
        departure of Shalmaneser IV. of Assyria to the abode of his god, and
        in Sargon, who succeeded him, the kingdom to all appearance accepted
        for the third time a ruler who might be described as an adventurer.
        Whether he, too, changed his name, in order to shine in borrowed
        plumes before the people, is unknown, but this is certain, that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Sargon the Later,”</span> as he called
        himself, by assuming that style and title, challenged comparison with
        an old Babylonian king of great renown, who made the little state
        which was his original principality the centre of a wide-spreading
        domain.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Strange as it may
        seem, until the discovery of the Assyrian inscriptions and their
        decipherment, nothing was known of this ruler outside of the Old
        Testament, his name being regarded as another name of Shalmaneser in
        the passage (Isa. xx. 1) where it occurs. Scholars did not realize
        that the Arkeanos of Ptolemy was the king here mentioned, and that
        the change in the form of his name was simply due to the change of
        the initial <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">s</span></em> into a breathing, according to a
        rule which is common in Greek etymology.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On assuming the
        government of the country, Sargon threw himself with energy into the
        Syrian war, though in his slab-inscription found at Nimroud, and in
        his annals, he makes his campaign against Ḫumbanigaš of Elam to
        precede his operations in the west. The following is the text of his
        <span class="tei tei-q">“State-Inscription”</span>—</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page363">[pg 363]</span><a name="Pg363" id="Pg363"

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

        27,290 people dwelling in the midst of it I carried off. Fifty
        chariots I collected among them, and allowed them to have the rest of
        their goods. My commander-in-chief I placed over them, and imposed

        the produce of the mountains, horses, (and) camels.”</span></p>

        Ṣimirra (Simyra), Dimašqa (Damascus), (and) Samerina (Samaria) to
        revolt against me, and caused them to agree together, and they
        assembled for battle. I collected the powerful troops of the god

        his warriors. I burned Qarqaru with fire. As for him, I flayed him. I

        about peace. I embodied 200 chariots (and) 600 cavalry among the
        people of the land of Amattu, and added to the force of my
        kingdom.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general
        opinion of Assyriologists is, that Shalmaneser did not succeed in
        making himself master of Samaria, the capture of the city falling to
        the honour <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page364">[pg
        364]</span><a name="Pg364" id="Pg364" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        Sargon, and this, as a matter of fact, is what the latter claims. As
        will be seen from the above extract, he states that he carried
        captive no less than 27,290 of the inhabitants of the city, but
        whither he transported them he does not say. According to 2 Kings
        xvii. 6, he placed them in Halah (probably the Ḫalaḫḫa of the
        inscriptions, near Haran), and by the river Habor (the Chaboras) in
        Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes. It is needless to say that
        these long journeys must in many cases have entailed much
        suffering.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
        Babylonian Chronicle, the conflict with Ḫumbanigaš took place in the
        second year of Merodach-baladan of Babylonia, which was the second
        year of Sargon as well. It is therefore difficult to understand why
        Sargon, in his record, places this event first. The reason why he
        dismisses the account of his conflict with the Elamite king in so few
        words is supposed to be, that he was in reality, as the Babylonian
        Chronicle says, defeated on that occasion. Though he might have
        wished to keep it in the background, his successes were so many, that
        there was no need for him to change the chronological order of his
        campaigns.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Sargon was
        naturally unable to be present at the siege and occupation of
        Samaria, which occurred too close to the date of his assuming power
        to allow him to reach the place. Besides that, his presence was
        needed nearer home, lest conspiracies should deprive him of his
        newly-acquired regal dignity. That he considered the successes of his
        troops in the west as a most important circumstance, however, is
        proved by the fact, that he devotes so much space in his annals to
        the account of it—and, indeed, the capture of 27,290 people is a
        thing of which any ruler might boast. There can be no doubt that the
        Assyrian kings, like the Babylonians before them, always desired to
        possess the dominion of the Mediterranean provinces, where were marts
        for the products both of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page365">[pg
        365]</span><a name="Pg365" id="Pg365" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        their lands and their people, and entry to the ports, for then, as
        now, all good rulers tried to further the interests of their subjects
        in distant lands, and were probably firmly of opinion, that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“trade followed the standard.”</span><a id=
        "noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In addition to
        this, there was the rivalry of Egypt, the country which had held
        these provinces in the past, and would have liked to regain them.
        Whether the rulers of the Mediterranean states realized this or not,
        is uncertain, but in any case, like the Israelites, they had no
        objection to making use of Egypt, <span class="tei tei-q">“bruised
        reed”</span> as she was by some considered. Seeing that there was
        danger from the Assyrians, Hanon of Gaza followed the example of
        Hoshea, in whom Shalmaneser had <span class="tei tei-q">“found
        conspiracy,”</span> and made overtures with Sib'e, the So of 2 Kings
        xvii. 4 (the word ought really to be pointed so as to read Seve,
        which was apparently the pronunciation of the Assyrian form, the
        aspirate having the effect of changing <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></em> into
        <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">bh</span></em> or <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">v</span></em>). This
        ruler is called <span class="tei tei-q">“king of Egypt”</span> in the
        passage cited, but Sargon says that he was <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Tartan,”</span> or commander-in-chief of the Egyptian
        army. This would imply that he was acting for another, a Pharaoh
        unnamed, and at present unknown. The general opinion is, that So or
        Sib'e is the same as Sabaco, and is called <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“king”</span> by anticipation in 2 Kings xvii.<a id=
        "noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The result was one
        exceedingly gratifying to the Assyrian king, for in the battle at
        Raphia, which followed, Sib'e fled in fear, whilst Hanon of Gaza was
        made prisoner. The defeat and flight of the Egyptian army does not
        seem to redound to the credit of its leader, who must have returned
        bitterly disappointed to his native land.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Immediately after,
        however, there is a reference to <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page366">[pg 366]</span><a name="Pg366" id="Pg366" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the receipt of tribute from <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Pir'u, king of the land of Muṣuru.”</span> This would be
        a natural result of the success of the Assyrians (so it seemed to the
        earlier Assyriologists), for surely Pir'u is Pharaoh, and Muṣuru is
        the Muṣur of other inscriptions, and stands for Egypt (the Heb.
        Misraim<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href=
        "#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a>). This
        however, is now denied, and Pir'u is said to be the name of a chief
        of an Arab tribe called Muṣuru. It reminds one of the Eri-Eaku of
        Larsa who is not Arioch of Elassar, contemporary of Kudur-laḫgumal of
        Elam who is not Chedorlaomer of Elam, and Tudḫula who is admittedly
        the same in name as Tidal, all of them ruling at or near the same
        period, but not those referred to in Gen. xiv. as contemporaries. In
        Assyriology, more than in any other study whatever, things are not
        what they seem, and must always be identified with something
        else.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
        annals, it would seem that Yau-bi'idi, who is there called
        Ilu-bi'idi, acted in concert with Sib'e of Egypt and Hanon of Gaza,
        the operations against him preceding those against the other two. The
        order of the translation given above would seem to be preferable, as
        it must have been in consequence of the flight of Sib'e <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“like a shepherd whose sheep had been lost,”</span> that
        Yau-bi'idi and Hanon of Gaza were so easily defeated. The former
        appears to have made Qarqaru the centre from which he intended to
        press his claim to the throne of Hamath, and he managed so well, that
        he got Arpad, Simyra, Damascus, and Samaria to join him. The Assyrian
        king, however, soon disposed of the pretensions of this prince, whom
        he describes as <span class="tei tei-q">“a loose (?) fellow, a
        usurper, a frivolous (?), evil man”</span> (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ṣab ḫubši,
        lâ-bêl-kussī, amēlu patû limnu</span></span>). After this it is not
        surprising that he thought he was justified in flaying him
        alive.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page367">[pg

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all appearance
        the state of affairs in Syria was satisfactory. The great victory of
        the Assyrians at Raphia had convinced the leaders of the various
        states of the uselessness of continuing to struggle against the power
        of the Assyrian king, who had nothing further to fear from Egypt, and
        was therefore free to occupy himself with other conquests. In 719,
        therefore, he turned his attention to the region of the north, the
        kingdoms of Van and Urarṭu or Ararat, the result of the operations
        against the latter being, that the people were transported to Syria,
        or, as the original has it, <span class="tei tei-q">“into Heth of the
        Amorites.”</span> The operations in 718 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> were against Kiakki of
        Sinuḫtu, a city in Tabal.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next year, 717
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, came the turn of
        Pisîris of Carchemish, who had tried to get Mitâ king of Musku to
        join him in a rebellion against Assyria. Assyrians were after this
        settled there, and Carchemish became an integral part of the Assyrian
        empire. The next entry in the Annals of Sargon is a reference to the
        Pâpites and the Lalluknites, <span class="tei tei-q">“dogs brought up
        in his palace,”</span> who planned treacherously against the land of
        Kakmê, though the full extent of their crime is not stated. These
        people were removed from their places, and sent down to the midst of
        Damascus of Amoria (Syria). In this year Ḫumbanigaš of Elam died, and
        was succeeded by Šutur-Nanḫundi, a man of a more peaceful character
        than his predecessor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Extensive
        operations, chiefly in Ararat, are recorded for 716 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, in which year also
        Bêl-šarra-uṣur, the city-chief of Kišešim, a Median province, was
        deposed, and his territory added to the boundaries of Assyria,
        together with several other west-Median districts. Among these was
        Ḫarḫar, whose city-chief was driven away by the Assyrian king. This
        city was re-peopled with prisoners of war, and its name having been
        changed to Kar-Šarru-ukîn, made the capital of the province. The war
        against Ararat continued during the next year, resulting in the
        submission of Yanzû king of <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page368">[pg
        368]</span><a name="Pg368" id="Pg368" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Na'iri or Mesopotamia. On the east, a rebellion in Ḫarḫar was put
        down, and the city fortified as a defence against Media. In this year
        people of Tumadu, Ibâdidu, Marsimanu, Ḫayapâ, and the remote Arbâa
        (Arabs?), an unlettered tribe which had never paid tribute to an
        Assyrian king, were overthrown, and the survivors transported to
        Samaria. The receipt of tribute from Pir'u king of Muṣuru, Samsi
        queen of Aribbu (Arabia), It'amra of the land of the Sabâa (Sabeans),
        kings of the sea-coast and the desert, consisting of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“gold, the produce of the mountain, precious stones,
        ivory, seeds of the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        recorded.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all appearance,
        Pir'u of Muṣuru is regarded as one of the kings of the sea-coast and
        the desert, but whether this is evidence against his being Pharaoh of
        Egypt or not, may be doubted. Egypt is as much a country of the
        sea-coast as any part of Palestine, but it is naturally on the south
        shore of the Mediterranean, and not on the east.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">714 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> saw the continuance of
        the war with Ararat and its allies, and seems to have resulted in its
        becoming an Assyrian province. In 713 expeditions were made, among
        other places, to west Media and Cilicia. In 712 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> he found himself
        obliged to proceed against Tarḫunazi of Meliddu, who, driven from his
        capital by the Assyrians, shut himself up in Tilgarimme, which had
        been identified with the Biblical Togarmah. This city, having been
        conquered, was repeopled with the nomad Sutî<a id="noteref_103" name=
        "noteref_103" href="#note_103"><span class=
        "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
        "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a> and
        placed under Assyrian rule.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this time, as
        Sargon says, he received the treasure (?) of the land of Heth (the
        high-lands of Syria), among the things sent being copper, iron, lead
        or tin, white marble from the Amanus mountains, royal garments of the
        colour of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">uknû</span></span>-stone (lapis-lazuli),

        id="Pg369" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> something which came from the
        mountain Ba'il-ṣapuna (Baal-zephon), <span class="tei tei-q">“a great
        mountain,”</span> and silver, which, in consequence of the large
        consignments received at Dûr-Sargina (Khorsabad), became in value
        like copper. The next year (711 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>) an expedition against
        Muttallu, son of Tarḫulara, one of the kings of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the land of Heth,”</span> took place. The son had killed
        his father and mounted the throne, hence the necessity for this
        campaign.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A similar
        expedition also took place to Ashdod. It happened that Azuri, king of
        the district of which Ashdod was the capital, had withheld the
        tribute agreed upon, and Sargon had therefore deposed him, and set
        his brother Aḫi-miti in his place. The following is Sargon's own
        account of this, and the sequel—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Azuri, king of Asdudu, planned in his heart not to send
        tribute, and sent to the kings around hostile expressions (towards)

        his dominion over the people of his land. Aḫi-miti, his brother next
        in order, I appointed to the kingdom over them. Men of Ḫattî,<a id=

        speaking treachery, hated his dominion, and raised up over them
        Yaana, a usurper, who like themselves knew no reverence for the
        dominion. In the anger of my heart I went hastily with the chariot of
        my feet and my cavalry, which for security quit not my side, to the
        city Asdudu, the city of his dominion, and the city Asdudu, the city
        Gimtu, (and) the city Asdudimma I besieged (and) captured. The gods
        dwelling in the midst of them, himself, with the people of his land,
        gold, silver, (and) the property of his palace, I counted as spoil.
        Their cities I rebuilt,<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href=
        "#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=

        settled therein the people of the lands captured by my hands. I
        placed my commander-in-chief as governor over them, and counted
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page370">[pg 370]</span><a name="Pg370"
        id="Pg370" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> them with the people of my
        land, and they bore my yoke.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
        inscription calls Yaana by the name of Yawani, and states that,
        hearing from far of the advance of the Assyrian army, he fled to the
        border of Muṣuru, which lies on the boundary of Meluḫḫa, and there
        hid himself. The king of Meluḫḫa seems thereupon to have feared for
        his own land, and placing Yatna in chains, sent him to Assyria. A
        third text referring to this campaign adds the following details—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“(People) of the land of Pilište (Philistia), the land of
        Yaudu (Judah), the land of Udumu (Edom), the land of Ma'abi (Moab),
        dwellers by the sea, bringers of the tribute and the gift of Aššur my
        lord, (for) sedition-mongering without measure, and evil, which was
        against me to cause hostility, unto Pir'u, king of the land of Muṣri,
        a prince who could not save them, they brought their homage-offering,
        and asked him for aid. I, Sargina, the true prince, fearing the oath
        of Lag-gi (= Nebo) and Merodach, keeper of the commands of the god
        Aššur, caused (my troops) to cross the Tigris and the Euphrates at
        high water, the fulness of the flood, as on dry land. And he, Yawani,
        their king, who trusted to his own power, and had not submitted to my
        dominion, heard from afar of the march of my expedition, and the
        glory of Aššur, my lord, overthrew him, and ... of the region of the
        river ... depth of the waters ... possession (?) of his land ... afar
        ... he fled ... Asdudu....”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In this, too,
        there is a reference to Pir'u, here called king of Muṣrí, either
        Egypt, or that mysterious and otherwise unknown kingdom to whose help
        so many trusted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The years 710 and
        709 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> were devoted to the
        operations against Merodach-baladan, the Chaldean prince who had made
        himself master of Babylonia. This is the Merodach-baladan who is
        referred to in 2 Kings xx. 12, but as his embassy really belongs to
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page371">[pg 371]</span><a name="Pg371"
        id="Pg371" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> a somewhat later date,
        reference will be made to it in its place. Suffice it here to say
        that he was a usurper on the Babylonian throne, head of the Chaldean
        tribe called Bît-Yakîn, and one of the most influential chieftains of
        the district. To all appearance, the Babylonians themselves (as in
        earlier days when they tried to seize the throne) preferred the
        Assyrians to the semi-barbarous Chaldeans and Arameans, with whom
        they were, in fact, in too close connection to have any great respect
        for. It is needless to say that this entirely fell in with the
        ambition of the kings of Assyria, who, from the time of
        Tukulti-Ninip, if not earlier, had desired, and sometimes obtained,
        dominion over Babylonia. Sargon, the successor of two kings of
        Assyria who were acknowledged to be at the same time kings of
        Babylonia, naturally regarded himself as inheriting that crown in
        virtue of his being king of Assyria, whilst the Babylonians
        themselves were probably not displeased with the idea that they
        formed part of the world-renowned and powerful Assyrian empire, whose
        kings spoke the same language as themselves, and with whose religion
        they were in sympathy. Thus it happened, therefore, that in the
        course of the operations against Merodach-baladan, success frequently
        crowned the arms of the Assyrians, and the inhabitants of Babylon,
        sending to Dûr-Ladinna, where Sargon was staying, brought him in
        solemn possession to Babylon, where he made the prescribed offerings
        to the gods, took up his abode in Merodach-baladan's palace, and
        received the tribute of the Babylonian tribes which he had
        subjugated. He still continued, however, his operations against
        Merodach-baladan, who was by no means willing to give up the
        struggle, to which there could be one end only, namely, the overthrow
        of the Chaldean king, which took place in 709 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst Sargon was
        busy in Babylonia, the governor of Quê invaded Musku (Mesech) and
        brought the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page372">[pg
        372]</span><a name="Pg372" id="Pg372" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        country to subjection. The seven kings of Cyprus also sent gifts, and
        a stele of Sargon was set up in the island, which, though mutilated,
        is of considerable importance, and is now preserved in the Berlin
        Museum. Kummuḫ (Comagene) was also added to the Assyrian empire (708
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>), and probably in the
        same year, a new king (in consequence of a dispute concerning the
        succession) set up in the land of Ellipu. In this reign also, the
        Elamites were generally against the Assyrians in their conflicts in
        Babylonia and on the eastern borders.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Concerning his
        death there is much uncertainty. The supposition is, that he was
        assassinated by one of his soldiers, as is indicated by the entry in

          already some experience as a ruler, having been the representative
          of his father Sargon in Armenia, where he had to receive and
          transmit the reports of the Assyrian generals, and probably also to
          administer the country. For the nations over which he was to rule,
          however, he was practically a new and untried administrator, of
          whose strength or weakness of character nothing was known.
          Merodach-baladan therefore took advantage of the death of Sargon
          and the succession of his son to come forth from his hiding-place,
          with such of his followers who were available, and an army placed
          at his disposal by the king of Elam. To all appearance the Chaldean
          ruler had taken advantage of the occupation of the Assyrian army
          elsewhere to possess himself of Babylon, which city Sennacherib
          entered, occupying Merodach-baladan's palace, and seizing all his
          treasures. Merodach-baladan fled and took refuge in Nagitu, on the
          other side of the Persian Gulf, so as to be near his Elamite
          allies.</p>

          taking, on his way, tribute from some of the more inaccessible

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is needless
          to say that the above long account differs considerably from that
          given in the Bible (2 Kings xviii. 13; Isa. xxxvi. 1 ff.), and it
          is very difficult to reconcile the two narratives. According to the
          account <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page377">[pg
          377]</span><a name="Pg377" id="Pg377" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          in Kings, Sennacherib came and took all the fenced cities of Judah,
          but there is no statement as to the reason why. The Assyrian king
          justifies his invasion of the country by stating that Hezekiah had
          sided with the inhabitants of Ekron in the deposition of their
          king, whom he had received from them and kept in prison. He even
          states that he brought him forth from Jerusalem and replaced him on
          the throne. That this circumstance is not referred to in the
          Biblical account, cannot be held to indicate that the Assyrian
          king's story is wrong, and only shows that the writer of the 2nd
          Book of the Kings did not think it of sufficient importance to
          record. In all probability, Hezekiah did not know at the time that
          Padî was an Assyrian vassal, otherwise he would not have incurred
          the risk of an invasion of his country by the dreaded Assyrians.
          The Biblical account then states that Hezekiah sent to the king at
          Lachish, saying that he had offended, and asking for terms, a fact
          which indicates that he was aware of having done something at which
          the king of Assyria might justly take offence. The answer was, the
          fixing of the amount of tribute which Hezekiah had to pay—300
          talents of silver and 30 talents of gold, this latter item agreeing
          with the statement of Sennacherib himself, though the amount of
          silver which he mentions—800 talents—is much greater. The sacrifice
          which Hezekiah made on this occasion (he had to strip off the gold
          from the doors of the Temple, and also from the pillars which he
          had overlaid, to make up the sum) was considerable. Concerning a
          siege of Jerusalem at this point, however, there is not a single
          word in the Biblical account, and the general opinion is, that the
          Assyrian king has purposely combined two accounts to give an
          appearance of success to what, in 2 Kings xix. 35-37, appears to
          have been a serious disaster to the Assyrian arms.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is worthy of
          note, however, that Josephus makes <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page378">[pg 378]</span><a name="Pg378" id="Pg378" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the siege of Jerusalem to have taken place
          when Sennacherib was returning from Egypt, where he had spent a
          long time besieging Pelusium (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Ant.</span></span> x. i. 4), which was
          regarded as the key of Egypt. In support of this he quotes
          Herodotus, who, according to him, made a great mistake <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“when he called this king not king of the Assyrians,
          but of the Arabians.”</span> This, however, is not quite correct,
          as Herodotus really says (book ii. 141), <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Sennacherib king of the Arabians and of the
          Assyrians.”</span> That it took place on his return from Egypt,
          however, is also stated by Berosus, whom Josephus quotes in full,
          as follows—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Now when Sennacherib was returning from his Egyptian
          war to Jerusalem, he found his army under Rabshakeh in great
          danger, for God had sent a pestilential distemper upon his army;
          and on the very first night of the siege, a hundred and eighty-five
          thousand, with their captains and generals, were destroyed. So the
          king was in a great dread, and in a terrible agony at this
          calamity; and being in great fear for his whole army, he fled with
          the rest of his forces to his own kingdom, and to his city Nineveh,
          and when he had abode there a little while, he was treacherously
          assaulted, and died by the hands of his elder sons, Adramelech and
          Sarasar, and was slain in his own temple which was called Araske.
          Now these sons of his were driven away on account of the murder of
          their father, by the citizens, and went into Armenia, whilst
          Assarachoddas took the kingdom of Sennacherib.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This would seem
          to be conclusive, especially as Sennacherib, according to his own
          records, made no expedition to Egypt before or at the time of that
          against the land of Ḫatti, which took place in the eponymy of
          Mitunu, prefect of Isana, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> 700 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, or the year
          immediately preceding. Now as Sennacherib died in 681 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, nearly twenty years
          elapsed between the campaign of which the account is above
          translated <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page379">[pg
          379]</span><a name="Pg379" id="Pg379" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          and his death. Berosus, however, states that, after the siege of
          Jerusalem, which ended so disastrously for him, he abode at Nineveh
          only <span class="tei tei-q">“a little while”</span> before he was
          murdered. There is then no doubt that there were two campaigns, and
          the events referred to in 2 Kings xviii. 13-xix. 37, though they
          seem to follow each other with little or no break, must have
          extended over a considerable period, the widest gap being in all
          probability between the sixteenth and seventeenth verses of ch.
          xviii. It is noteworthy that, at this point, the Hebrew indicates
          the end of a paragraph, though not a change of subject.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Affairs in
          Babylonia now occupied the attention of Sennacherib for many years,
          in consequence of the many revolutions there, which were largely
          fomented, aided and abetted by the Elamites. In 703 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, two pretenders,
          Marduk-zakir-šumi and Marduk-âbla-iddina, held the throne in
          succession for a few months, but Sennacherib put an end to this
          rule by setting on the throne a Chaldean named Bêl-ibnî
          (Belibus).<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href=
          "#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a> This
          took place when he defeated Merodach-baladan, before the campaign
          against the West. Evidently, however, he was not satisfied with the
          rule of his nominee, who had probably been plotting against him,
          and therefore entered the country again in 699 <span class=
          "tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, carried away
          Bêl-ibnî prisoner, and set on the throne his own eldest son,
          Aššur-nadin-šum. After this seems to have occurred his fifth
          expedition, which was to the mountainous region where lay the
          cities Tumurru, Šarum or Šarma, Ezema, Kibšu, Ḫalbuda, Qûa, and
          Qana, in the neighbourhood of Cilicia, his objective being the city
          Ukku, which was taken and spoiled.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst absent on
          this expedition, however, the Elamites seem to have been again
          plotting against the Assyrians in Babylonia. This being the case,
          Sennacherib went in <span class="tei tei-q">“ships of the land of
          Ḫatti”</span> to <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page380">[pg
          380]</span><a name="Pg380" id="Pg380" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the place where Merodach-baladan<a id="noteref_112" name=
          "noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a> had
          taken refuge, namely, <span class="tei tei-q">“Nagitu of
          Elam.”</span><a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href=
          "#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a> On
          this occasion, he claims to have captured Šûzubu (otherwise
          Nergal-ušêzib), and carried him in chains to Assyria. This led to
          reprisals on the part of the Elamites, who invaded Babylonia,
          carried Aššur-nadin-šum, the king, Sennacherib's son, prisoner, and
          set on the throne Nergal-ušêzib, who, if he be the Šûzubu referred
          to by Sennacherib, must have escaped from the custody of the
          Assyrians. This was in 693 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nergal-ušêzib
          only ruled for a year or eighteen months, and was captured (?
          again) by the Assyrians. The Assyrian king now ravaged Elam
          <span class="tei tei-q">“from Râš to Bît-Burnaki,”</span> but his
          army would have been better employed in watching over affairs in
          Babylonia, where another pretender, Mušêzib-Marduk, sat on the
          throne, and ruled for four years. During this time he, too, found
          that his seat was not altogether a bed of roses, for Menanu, king
          of Elam, after a battle with the Assyrians,<a id="noteref_114"
          name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a>
          captured Mušêzib-Marduk with an army composed of Elamites and
          Babylonians, and delivered him to the Assyrians. Sennacherib now
          again (688 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>) became king of
          Babylonia, and it is thought that, on taking possession of the
          capital again, out of revenge for the loss of his son, and on
          account of the trouble he had had in consequence of the Babylonians
          running after the many pretenders, with which the land seems to
          have teemed, he destroyed <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page381">[pg
          381]</span><a name="Pg381" id="Pg381" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          the city of Babylon, committing such cruelties that they were
          remembered to the end, and sowed the seeds of that hatred which
          were to bring forth for Assyria that deadliest of all fruit—her own
          destruction.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the eight
          years which passed between his assuming the reins of power in
          Babylonia and his death, must be placed that expedition to Egypt
          spoken of by Berosus and Herodotus. The version of the former,
          which refers principally to the siege of Jerusalem, is quoted above
          (p. <a href="#Pg378" class="tei tei-ref">378</a>); the following is
          the account of the latter—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“After this, Sanacharib, king of the Arabians and of
          the Assyrians, marched a great host against Egypt. Then the
          warriors of the Egyptians refused to come to the rescue, and the
          priest (Hephaistos, whose name was Sethos),<a id="noteref_115"
          name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a> being
          driven into a strait, entered into the sanctuary of the temple and
          bewailed to the image of the god the danger which was impending
          over him; and as he was thus lamenting, sleep came upon him, and it
          seemed to him in his vision that the god came out and stood by him
          and encouraged him, saying that he should suffer no evil if he went
          forth to meet the army of the Arabians, for he would himself send
          him helpers. Trusting in these things seen in sleep, he took with
          him, they say, those of the Egyptians who were willing to follow
          him, and encamped in Pelusion, for by this way the invasion came;
          and not one of the warrior class followed him, but shopkeepers and
          artisans and men of the market. Then after they came, there swarmed
          by night upon the enemies mice of the fields, and ate up their
          quivers and their bows, and moreover the handles of their shields,
          so that on the next day they fled, and being without defence of
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page382">[pg 382]</span><a name=
          "Pg382" id="Pg382" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> arms great numbers
          fell. And at the present time this king stands in the temple of
          Hephaistos in stone, holding upon his head a mouse, and by letters
          inscribed he says these words, <span class="tei tei-q">‘Let him who
          looks upon me learn to fear the gods.’</span> ”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Josephus's
          quotation from Herodotus differs somewhat from the above, in that
          he makes the Egyptian king to pray to God (and not before his
          image), and omits all reference to the dream. This was doubtless to
          make the parallel with the case of Hezekiah more striking.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The precise date
          of this expedition to Egypt and second siege of Jerusalem is
          unknown, but it must have taken place between 688 and 680
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> It is not by any
          means improbable that the date may some time or other be fixed, for
          an account of it will probably be found in the ruins of the cities
          of Assyria somewhere. That Herodotus calls Sennacherib <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“king of the Arabians and the Assyrians”</span> is
          probably due to the fact that he seems to have been in alliance
          with <span class="tei tei-q">“the queen of the
          Aribi”</span>—<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          Esarhaddon speaks of his father Sennacherib as having captured the
          Arabian city Adumū, and inscriptions of Aššur-banî-âpli also refer
          to Sennacherib's expedition thither, and to his connection with an
          Arabian king named Ḫaza-îlu (Hazael). With regard to Palestine
          itself, the reality of the siege of Lachish is testified to by the
          fact, that a large portion of Sennacherib's sculptures represent
          him as being present at the siege of Lachish in person, when the
          prisoners and the booty taken were passed before him in procession.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It would be
          strange indeed if this event, of which he was evidently very proud,
          were omitted from the history of what he must have regarded as his
          glorious deeds. As it does not occur in the account of his
          expedition to the land of Ḫatti, there is hardly any doubt that it
          belongs to the later campaign there, when he took the city, though
          he failed, as has been seen, to take Jerusalem. In all probability
          there were two sieges of Lachish, and it was very possible that the
          city was taken only on the second occasion. In any case, it was
          from Lachish that Sennacherib sent the Tartan, the Rabsaris, and
          the Rabshakeh to Hezekiah, with a great army to besiege Jerusalem,
          and it is noteworthy that the Rabshakeh reproaches him with
          trusting to Egypt, the power with which Assyria was at that moment
          in conflict; and in Sennacherib's second message to Hezekiah (2
          Kings xix. 9) the words accompanying it clearly show that the
          general opinion was, that it was the march of Tirhakah against him
          which called it forth. It is noteworthy in this connection, that
          Tirhakah cannot have been on the throne of Egypt so early as 700
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, the date of
          Sennacherib's first campaign against the West.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There are
          therefore many arguments in favour of two expeditions of
          Sennacherib to Palestine, with two sieges of Jerusalem, and also,
          to all appearance, two sieges of Lachish.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following is
          the account of his death given in the Babylonian Chronicle—</p>

          of the month Tebet until the 2nd day of the month Adar, the revolt
          in Assyria continued. Month Adar, day 18th, Aššur-âḫâ-iddina

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
          Berosus, who agrees with the Biblical account in this, it was two
          of his sons who killed him, but it may be taken that, though they
          were both morally responsible, one only actually performed the
          deed. Shareser is not mentioned, either by Abydenus or Polyhistor,
          as taking part in the murder; it would seem to be very probable,
          that Adrammelech was the culprit. From Berosus it is also clear
          that Esarhaddon had nothing to do with it, and this is to a certain
          extent confirmed by his inscriptions, which, as will be seen
          farther on, represent him as warring in Armenia, whither his
          brothers had fled.</p>

          received chronology, the assassination of Sennacherib and the

          greatly to be regretted that the royal inscriptions of Esarhaddon
          have not come down to us in a complete state, and also that we do
          not possess the later portions of the Assyrian Eponym Canon with
          historical references, which would enable us to fix the date of the
          campaigns. Of course, there is every probability that they are
          mentioned in chronological order, but as their dates are not
          stated, at least some uncertainty must prevail.</p>

          impossible to say with certainty whether the recital, in forcible
          though apparently well-chosen language, of what took place in
          Ḫanigalbat, or Mesopotamia, belongs to the account of the conflict
          with his brothers (who would have liked to overthrow Esarhaddon
          that one of them might reign in his stead) or not. The wording,
          however, makes it very probable that the narrative does refer to
          them, for he overtook them on the Nineveh road, and the
          disappearance of their resistance was more than gratifying to the

          the mutilation of the record, by which the beginning is wanting,
          has deprived us of the names of both conspirators, which are,
          therefore, only preserved by the Bible, Berosus, Abydenus, and
          Polyhistor. Various have been the conjectures as to what the true
          Assyrian forms of the names would be, and only one, that of
          Adrammelech, has been found with any probability of its being the
          right one. The name in question is that of Aššur-munik, or, perhaps
          better, Aššur-mulik, for whom Sennacherib built a palace. From its
          form in Hebrew, Sharezer should be Šar-uṣur in Assyrian,

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though
          Esarhaddon's inscriptions do not give any chronological data, the
          Babylonian chronicle indicates the dates of his campaigns with
          sufficient precision. From it we learn that in his first year he
          had to put <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page386">[pg
          386]</span><a name="Pg386" id="Pg386" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          down a rebellion in Ur, led by Zēru-kênu-lîšir, whom Esarhaddon
          calls Nabû-zēr-napišti-lîšir, son of Merodach-baladan. In the year
          676 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, his expedition to
          Sidon took place, and Abdi-milkutti, the king, was beheaded in 675.
          After taking the spoil of the city, he says that he <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“assembled the kings of Ḫatti and the sea-coast, all of
          them,”</span> and there is every probability that it was at this
          time that he <span class="tei tei-q">“took Menasseh with
          hooks,”</span> or, as the Revised Version has it, with chains, and
          bound him with fetters, and brought him to Babylon, where, as
          sovereign of that land also, he sometimes held court. Though
          severe, and probably also cruel sometimes, Esarhaddon was more
          mercifully inclined than his father, and allowed Menasseh to resume
          the reins of government at Jerusalem. There is no reference to this
          in the inscriptions of Esarhaddon, though he mentions, in his list
          of tributaries, Menasseh king of the city of Judah. This list,
          which is from a cylinder-inscription, is as follows—</p>

          happened, that Aššur-banî-âpli, on coming to the throne, found
          himself involved in a war with Egypt. To such a ruler, it must have
          seemed a hard thing to relinquish what his father had fought, and
          perhaps died, to acquire and retain. This being the case, he sent
          forth his army to reduce the country again to subjection, Tirhakah
          having taken advantage of the death of Esarhaddon to revolt. In the
          course of this campaign his representative (there is every
          probability that Aššur-banî-âpli never went westwards, or, indeed,
          made any warlike expedition in person whatever) received the
          tribute of the kings of the sea-coast and <span class=

          "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span>
          Phœnicia and Cyprus. This list is, with few exceptions, the same as
          that given by Esarhaddon, and <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

          Menasseh) of the land of Yaudi or Judah. In some cases, however,
          changes had taken place and these are duly registered—Yakinlû
          instead of Matan-ba'al, king of the land of Aruada (Arvad);
          Ammi-nadbi (Amminadab), king of the land of Bît-Ammana
          (Beth-Ammon), instead of Budu-ilu. For the kings of Cyprus,
          however, no change is indicated, a circumstance which leads one to
          look upon the list with some suspicion, it being not impossible
          that the names of certain rulers are inserted to make a seeming
          addition to the Assyrian king's glory. They are all represented,
          however, as supporting, with their troops and their ships, on land
          and on sea, the army of Aššur-banî-âpli. The result was the defeat
          of Tirhakah, and the restoration of the kings, prefects, and
          governors whom Esarhaddon had appointed as rulers of the
          country.<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">No sooner had
          the Assyrians departed, than Tirhakah won over all the princes they
          had installed to his side, and the work had to be done over again.
          The Assyrian generals, however, returned promptly, and the
          rebellion was at once put down. Of the princes who were captured,
          Necho alone was spared, and, with his son, set as ruler in
          Ḫatḫariba (Athribis). About this time Tirhakah died, and Urdamanê,
          son of Sabaco, mounted the throne, and made Thebes and On
          (Heliopolis) his principal strongholds, besieging the Assyrian army
          of occupation in Memphis. Another expedition on the part of the
          Assyrians therefore became necessary, and was at once undertaken,
          and with complete success, except that Urdamanê remained, to all
          appearance, still at large. Practically, however, the greater part
          of Egypt became at this time an Assyrian province.</p><span class=

          class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But many were
          the conquests of this really remarkable king, which his generals
          accomplished for him. Soon came the turn of Ba'al, king of Tyre,
          whose subjection brought about that of Yakinlû, king of Arvad,
          Mugallu, king of Tubal, and Sandasarme of the land of the Ḫilakkâa
          (Cilicians). Aššur-banî-âpli also speaks of the mission of Yakinlû,
          king of Arvad, who sent his sons to him with presents, and made
          obeisance. These princes bore the interesting names Azi-ba'al,
          Abi-ba'al, Aduni-ba'al, Sapati-baal, Pudi-baal, Ba'al-yašupu,
          Ba'al-ḫanunu, Ba'al-maluku, Abi-milki, and Aḫi-milki, showing the
          popularity of the element <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">baal</span></span>
          in the names of the people of Arvad. Azi-ba'al was designated as
          the next king, and all the brothers were sent back with rich gifts.
          He also tells the story of the dream of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Guggu šar
          Luddi</span></span> (Gyges, king of Lydia), to whom the god Aššur
          is said to have appeared, exhorting him to submit to
          Aššur-banî-âpli, and overcome his enemies by invoking his name.
          Following this advice, he succeeded in conquering the Gimmirrâa
          (people of Gomer), capturing their chiefs, of whom he sent two in
          fetters to the Assyrian king, with valuable gifts.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gyges did not
          send any more embassies, however, and allied himself with
          Tušamilki, king of the land of Muṣur (generally regarded as
          Psammeticus of Egypt, but to all appearance another Muṣur—probably
          that to the north—is meant), and for this he received the curse of
          the Assyrian king. The result was, that the Gimmirrâa came and
          ravaged his country. This being the case, his son, who succeeded
          him, thought best to renew the Assyrian alliance, and therefore
          sent an embassy with a message to the following effect—<span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The king whom god hath chosen art thou; thou cursedst
          my father, and evil was wrought before him. As for me, the servant
          fearing thee, be gracious to me and let me bear thy
          yoke.”</span></p>

          Aššur-banî-âpli's other campaigns were against the Vannites, the
          Elamites, the Babylonians (on account of his brother Saosduchinos,
          king of that country, refusing to acknowledge his suzerainty),
          after that twice more against Elam, then against the Arabians, and
          finally against Ummanaldaš, king of Elam, whom he seized as a hawk
          does his prey. In all, however, he captured four Elamite princes,
          whom he caused to be attached to his carriage (<span class=

          as for the Arabian princes whom he had taken as prisoners, he
          caused them to wear chains and badges of service, and to work at
          the building of his palace, as was the custom in those days.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We can easily
          imagine him—the great and noble Aššur-banî-âpli, called by Ezra
          (iv. 10) Asnapper (better Asenappar), who transferred the Dinaites,
          Apharsathchites, Tarpelites, Apharsites, Archevites, Babylonians,
          Susanchites (Susanians), Dehavites, and Elamites, to swell the
          mixed multitudes in the cities of Samaria. Many a time is he
          represented in the beautiful bas-reliefs which he caused to be
          carved as the adornments of his palace at Nineveh, and we there see
          him, the patron of art, as the bold sportsman and hunter, just as
          his tablets show him as the greatest patron of literature of his
          time, one who knew the literature of his race, who took a pride in
          learning, and himself copied out tablets <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“in the assembly of the experts.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“great and noble Asnapper”</span> is worthy of a statue
          in every land where the languages of Assyria and Babylonia are

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">How the sudden

          probability it remained intact until the death of Aššur-banî-âpli,
          which took place in 626 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> His son,
          Aššur-êtil-îlāni-ukinni, has left no historical records, though it
          is not by any means impossible that some light may ultimately be
          thrown on his reign. One of the enigmas of his time is: What was
          the circumstance which called forth the following
          communication?—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“The message of the daughter of the king to Aššurâaitu
          the queen. As yet thou writest not thy tablet, and dictatest not
          thy letter? Shall they say thus: <span class="tei tei-q">‘Is this
          the sister of Šerû-êṭerat, the eldest daughter of the Harem-house

          king of the world, the king of Assyria?’</span> And thou art the
          daughter of the bride, the lady of the house of Aššur-banî-âpli,
          the son of the great king of the Harem-house, who was
          Aššur-âḫa-iddina (Esarhaddon), king of Assyria.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Some of the
          expressions in this letter seem obscure, but the probable
          explanation is, that the daughter of one of the last Assyrian
          kings—perhaps Sin-šarra-iškun (Saracos)—writes to the chief wife of
          Aššur-banî-âpli urging her to take action by exhorting the chiefs
          of the nation at a crisis in the history of the country, which
          crisis was probably that which led to the downfall of the mighty
          kingdom which had reached its zenith of power during the reign of
          Aššur-banî-âpli. At this time, according to Nabonidus, a king of
          the Umman-manda or Medes, whose name is doubtful, but which may be
          Iriba-tuktê, entered into alliance with a ruler who must be
          Nabopolassar of Babylon, the father of Nebuchadnezzar, and
          accomplished the vengeance of Merodach, the god of the Babylonians,
          who willed that the destruction wrought upon his city by
          Sennacherib should be amply avenged. This vengeance was apparently
          the downfall of the Assyrian empire and the destruction
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page393">[pg 393]</span><a name=
          "Pg393" id="Pg393" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of Nineveh, in
          accordance with statements of Alexander Polyhistor, Abydenus, and
          Syncellus. It is Diodorus Siculus, however, who gives the fullest
          account. He relates that there was a legend (according to an
          oracle) that the city could not be taken until the river became its
          enemy. Arbaces, the Scythian, was besieging it, but was unable to
          make any great impression on it for two years. In the third year,
          however, the river<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href=
          "#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a> was
          swollen by rains, and being very rapid in its current, a portion of
          the wall was carried away, by which the besiegers gained an
          entrance. The king, recognizing in this the fulfilment of the
          oracle, raised a funeral pyre, and gathering together his
          concubines and eunuchs, mounted it, and perished in the flames.
          Thus came the great Assyrian empire to an end.</p>

          annihilation of a whole nation. Who can imagine their despair? Less
          than fifty years earlier, Assyria had been the most powerful nation
          of the then known world, and the people suddenly saw themselves
          deprived of that proud position which they had enjoyed for so many
          centuries. Their national existence had, in fact, been brought to
          an abrupt end, but the few Assyrian names which appear in
          Babylonian contracts many years after their downfall show that
          theirs was a proud indomitable spirit, which could not give way to
          misfortune, and which probably hoped for better things and more
          prosperous times. Their descendants are still to be found among the
          Chaldean Roman Catholic Christians of the country which was the
          scene of their forefathers' dominion when they ruled the land of
          their inheritance. Their most worthy representatives in modern
          times are the family of the Rassams, one of whom was for many years
          British Consul at Mossoul (a post which his nephew now fills), and
          another is the well-known veteran, Hormuzd Rassam, Layard's helper,

        Hezekiah with a present and kind inquiries as to his health,

        that he could get against the Assyrians, with whom he was in constant
        conflict. With the downfall of Assyria, however, all was changed. The
        Jews' whilom friend became their enemy, and, as indicated in 2 Kings
        xx. 17 ff., the Israelites were to lose their independence at the
        hands of the descendants of those who were then seeking their
        friendship.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is hardly
        any doubt that the later Assyrian kings regarded Babylonia as an
        integral part of the Assyrian empire, and had perfect faith in the
        fidelity of the inhabitants. It may reasonably be doubted, however,
        whether the Babylonians had really forgotten <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page396">[pg 396]</span><a name="Pg396" id="Pg396" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> the cruel treatment they had received at the
        hands of Sennacherib. In addition to this, there must have existed
        for a considerable period the feeling that they, the Babylonians,
        were the more ancient people of the two, and that the Assyrians were
        but a later offshoot of their own stock, owing to them all their
        civilization, manners, customs, laws, and literature. It will thus be
        seen that they were sufficiently of the same origin to be regarded as
        one people, and for this reason, many of the cities of Babylonia were
        satisfied and happy under Assyrian rule, which they preferred, to all
        appearance, to that of the Chaldeans, a nation which, though
        inhabiting their own borders, was in reality more alien to them than
        the Assyrians in language, manners, and customs, and whom they
        probably regarded as being only half civilized.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The general
        opinion is, that Nabû-âbla-uṣur (Nabopolassar), the general whom
        Sin-šarra-iškun (Saracos), the last king of Assyria, sent against his
        enemies (who seem to have invaded Babylonia by sea at the northern
        end of the Persian Gulf), was a Chaldean, and this is, in fact,
        confirmed by the quotation in Eusebius's Armenian Chronicle (p. 44)
        from Polyhistor, where it is stated that after Samuges
        (Šamaš-šum-ukîn, the brother of Aššur-banî-âpli), Sardanapallus (this
        is a mistake for Nabopollasarus), the Chaldean, reigned for
        twenty-one years. If this be the case, it is a matter of surprise
        that Sin-šarra-iškun should have given into the hands of one
        belonging to a tribe of old hostile to Assyria, the command of his
        army at such a critical time. In any case, the result was most
        disastrous for Assyria, as the foregoing chapter has shown.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the opinion of
        Friedrich Delitzsch, Nabopolassar was not the general of
        Sin-šarra-iškun, but in all probability a viceroy installed by
        Aššur-êtil-îlāni-ukinni, and retained by Sin-šarra-iškun, in which
        case it is to be supposed that he made an alliance with the
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page397">[pg 397]</span><a name="Pg397"
        id="Pg397" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Medes (as related by Alexander
        Polyhistor and Abydenus), and cemented it by marrying his son
        Nebuchadrezzar to Amunhean, Amuhean, or Amytis, daughter of Astyages,
        king of the Medes; and according to the latter author, it was after
        this that he marched against Nineveh. Fried. Delitzsch may therefore
        be regarded as most probably right, for the king of the Medes would
        hardly have consented to bestow his daughter upon the son of one whom
        he could not otherwise have regarded as being of royal race.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though
        Nabopolassar had close connection with Syria, his name is not
        mentioned in the Bible narrative. For our information concerning him
        we are indebted to Josephus, who, quoting the Babylonian writer
        Berosus, relates what was recorded in the Babylonian chronicles of
        that period. After the division of the territory of Assyria, of which
        Egypt took a part, the former allies began to quarrel among
        themselves, the result being that Nabopolassar, wishing to regain
        possession of Syria, which at this time acknowledged the suzerainty
        of Egypt, decided to attack that country. According to Berosus, he
        not only regarded himself as master of Coele-Syria and Phœnicia, but
        also of Egypt. Hearing, therefore, <span class="tei tei-q">“that the
        governor which he had set over Egypt and over the parts of
        Coele-Syria and Phœnicia had revolted from him, he was not able to
        bear it any longer, but committing certain parts of his army to his
        son Nabuchodonosor, who was then but young, he sent him against the
        rebel.”</span> This is regarded as having taken place in 605
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> The governor attacked
        by the young Nebuchadnezzar was apparently Necho, who was completely
        defeated at Carchemish, and expelled from Syria.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whilst upon this
        expedition, Nebuchadnezzar heard of the death of his father at
        Babylon, in the twenty-first year of his reign, as Josephus, quoting
        Berosus, has it. This accords with the statement concerning
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page398">[pg 398]</span><a name="Pg398"
        id="Pg398" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> him in the Canon of Ptolemy,
        and also with native Babylonian chronology, as may be seen from a
        tablet in the Museum of Edinburgh, of which the following is a
        translation—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Returning to
        Babylon, the young prince found that his supporters there had looked
        after his interests, and no pretender having appeared to dispute with
        him the throne, he was at once acknowledged king. The death of
        Nabopolassar and the accession of his son Nebuchadnezzar took place
        in the year 604 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Unfortunately, but
        few inscriptions of Nabopolassar have been found, and of them some
        are duplicates, and all refer to his architectural or engineering
        works. The principal treats of his restoration of the temple
        Ê-temen-ana-kia, the shrine at Ê-sagila, which the Babylonians
        regarded as the Tower of Babel. It is written in the archaic style of
        writing much affected by his son Nebuchadnezzar, and has certain
        peculiarities of spelling. Like most of the pious architectural
        inscriptions of Babylonia, there is no reference to historical
        events, but the king speaks of Nabium-kudurra-uṣur (Nebuchadrezzar),
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the eldest, firstborn, and beloved of my
        heart,”</span> and his younger brother, Nabû-šumam-lìšir. Both the
        king and his two sons took part in the restoration of the temple,
        bringing with their own hands material for the work, the younger son
        also assisting by pulling the cord of the <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page399">[pg 399]</span><a name="Pg399" id="Pg399" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> cart which carried it. The receptacles which
        they used to carry the material were made of gold and silver. Other
        inscriptions of this king refer to the digging out of the canal of
        the Euphrates near the city Sippara, and to Nabopolassar's
        restoration of the temple of <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lady of
        Sippar,”</span> called Ê-edinna, <span class="tei tei-q">“the house
        (temple) of the plain,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“of
        Edina,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Eden.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">When
        Nebuchadnezzar (in Babylonian Nabû-kudurri-uṣur—he was the second of
        the name) came to the throne, he found himself in possession of a
        mighty kingdom, consolidated by his father's talent, and he could
        himself boast of having had a hand in its enlargement and greater
        security. Everything was, to all appearance, at peace, and the new
        king had no reason to fear either a pretender to the throne, or the
        advent of enemies from without. One of his tributaries, namely,
        Jehoiakim, king of Judah, after paying tribute three years (604-602
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>), rebelled, but was
        again reduced to subjection (2 Kings xxiv. 1 ff.).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Later, however,
        uprisings of a more earnest nature came to the ears of the Babylonian
        king, constraining him to act. Apparently in consequence of the
        promises of Egypt, Jehoiachin, son of Jehoiakim, brought against
        himself the hostility of the king of Babylon, who sent an army to
        besiege Jerusalem, afterwards journeying thither himself, the result
        being, that the city was taken, and the Jewish king, with his court,
        yielded, and were carried away to Babylon (598 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>). The number of
        captives on this occasion exceeded 10,000, and the treasures of the
        palace and the Temple formed part of the spoils sent to Babylon. The
        country was not annexed, however, for Nebuchadnezzar made Mattaniah
        king of Judah instead of Jehoiachin, changing his name to
        Zedekiah.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Gratitude to the
        power which had raised him, however, became weakened with years, and,
        encouraged by Pharaoh Hophra, he rebelled in the ninth year of his
        reign, the result being that Jerusalem was once <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page400">[pg 400]</span><a name="Pg400" id="Pg400"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> more besieged. Pharaoh Hophra now marched
        with an army across the Egyptian border to the help of his ally,
        whereupon the Babylonians raised the siege of Jerusalem for a time to
        get rid of the invader (Jer. xxxvii. 5-7). According to Josephus, the
        Egyptians were totally defeated, and returned to their own land (Jer.
        xxxvii. 7). The siege of Jerusalem was then resumed, and the city was
        taken at the end of a year and a half, notwithstanding a very
        courageous resistance. The date set down for this event is July 586
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Zedekiah with his
        army fled, but was pursued by the Chaldeans, and captured in the
        plains of Jericho. Nebuchadnezzar was then at Riblah, where, to all
        appearance, a court was held (see 2 Kings xxv. 6), and sentence
        pronounced against the faithless vassal, whose sons were then slain
        before his eyes, his sight destroyed, and he himself carried captive
        to Babylon. It was a barbarous sentence, and was quite in accordance
        with the customs of the age, just as the legal formalities were to
        all appearance in conformity with Babylonian tradition. The
        destruction of the Temple and all the principal houses of the city by
        fire, followed, this destruction being wrought by Nebu-zar-adan
        (Nabû-zēr-iddina), the captain of Nebuchadnezzar's guard, who also
        carried captive all who remained in the city. Only the lowest class
        of the people remained to carry on the cultivation of the land.
        Others were sent to Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah, and by his orders put
        to death. Those of the Jews who remained, however, were not placed,
        as might reasonably have been expected, under a Babylonian governor,
        but under Gedeliah the son of Ahikam, who was made governor. His
        death at the hands of his own countrymen took place shortly after,
        thus putting an end to the last vestige of native Jewish rule in
        Palestine.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Next came the turn
        of Tyre, which the Babylonian king blockaded for no less than
        thirteen years (585-573 <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page401">[pg
        401]</span><a name="Pg401" id="Pg401" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>), but was apparently
        successful in the end, when the inhabitants acknowledged Babylonian
        overlordship. That its capture cost him great pains is testified by
        Ezekiel (xxix. 18), who states that, to take the city, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“every head was bald, and every shoulder was
        peeled”</span> in consequence of the carrying of material for the
        operations against the city, yet neither he nor his army reaped any
        material advantage from this conquest, <span class="tei tei-q">“for
        the service that he had served against it.”</span> The name of a city
        Ṣûru, which is probably Tyre, occurs on a tablet dated in
        Nebuchadnezzar's thirty-fifth year (569 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>—four years after the
        city was taken). It refers to a transaction in which sesame is sold,
        an official of the city being a party to the contract. Later on, in
        the fortieth year of Nebuchadnezzar, a contract was entered into
        between Milki-idiri, governor of Kidis (Kedesh), with regard to some
        cattle. This document is dated at Tyre (Ṣurru) on the 22nd of the
        month Tammuz. Not only Tyre, therefore, but the whole district, owned
        the dominion of Nebuchadnezzar at this time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Just as successful
        were Nebuchadnezzar's operations against Egypt. According to an
        Egyptian inscription, the Babylonian king attacked Egypt in the year
        572 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, penetrating as far as
        Syene and the borders of Ethiopia. Hophra, who still reigned, was
        defeated and deposed, the general Amasis being raised to the throne
        in his place to rule the land as a vassal of the Babylonian king.
        According to the only historical fragment of the reign of this king
        known, Nebuchadnezzar made an expedition to Egypt in his
        thirty-seventh year. This was to all appearance against his vassal
        Amasis, who, like Zedekiah, had revolted against the power which had
        raised him to the throne. The rebellion was suppressed, but the
        ultimate fate of Amasis is not stated.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
        Megasthenes, who lived in the time of Seleucus Nicator,
        Nebuchadnezzar conquered North <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page402">[pg 402]</span><a name="Pg402" id="Pg402" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Africa, crossing afterwards into Spain by the
        Strait of Gibraltar, returning to Babylonia through Europe and Asia
        Minor. Such an expedition, however, it is hardly likely that he ever
        undertook, and the account of this exploit may therefore be relegated
        to the domain of the fables with which the ancient historians
        sometimes ornamented their work.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Concerning the
        relations of Nebuchadnezzar with Daniel, the wedge-inscriptions of
        Babylonia give no indication whatever. Four hundred and fifty or more
        contract-tablets dated in his reign are known, but in none of them is
        there any reference to Daniel, at least in a form that can be
        recognized. The Babylonian name given to him, Belteshazzar, is
        apparently an abbreviated form, which would be, in Babylonian,
        Balaṭ-su-ûṣur, <span class="tei tei-q">“Protect thou (O God), his
        life.”</span> If this be the explanation, a better transcription of
        the Hebrew form would be Beletshazzar (making the first sheva vocal
        and the second silent instead of the reverse). The name of the deity
        has, in accordance with custom, been suppressed in the Hebrew form,
        but it is probable that either the patron-deity of Babylon, Bêl, or
        else the favourite deity of the Babylonians in general, Nebo, the god
        of learning, may have preceded the first element as the name now
        stands. In the inscriptions of Babylonia and Assyria, many examples
        of abbreviated names occur, on account of what we should consider
        their inordinate length, and to such an extent was this customary,
        that one element only, out of three or four, might alone be used.
        Thus, in the contracts of the time of Nebuchadnezzar, at least
        fourteen persons of the name of Balaṭu, and seven of the name of
        Balaṭ-su occur, and it may be safely taken that they are all
        abbreviations of names similar to that bestowed upon Daniel. Apart
        from the question whether the Book of Daniel is to be regarded as a
        part of the Hagiographa or not, the fact that his descent is not
        given there would <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page403">[pg
        403]</span><a name="Pg403" id="Pg403" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        make it impossible to recognize him, if his name was still further
        abbreviated by the Babylonians, among so many bearing names possibly
        the same as his. Even though his book be regarded as a romance, there
        is always the question, whether the personages mentioned therein may
        not really have existed.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">With regard to the
        other names in Daniel, it is to be noted that Shadrach and Meshach,
        the names given to Hananiah and Mishael, are doubtful in Babylonian,
        the corresponding forms not having been found. Abednego, on the other
        hand, the Babylonian name of Azariah, has long been recognized as
        being written for Abed-Nebo, <span class="tei tei-q">“servant of
        Nebo,”</span> either by a scribal error, or (as seems more probable)
        in order to deface the name of a heathen deity. The name of Ashpenaz,
        the master of the eunuchs, is still more doubtful, if anything; but
        that of Arioch, the <span class="tei tei-q">“king's captain,”</span>
        is one which has been well known for some time, being none other than
        the ancient name (cf. Genesis xiv.) corresponding with the Akkadian
        Êri-Aku or Êri-Eaku, <span class="tei tei-q">“servant of the
        Moon-god,”</span> a rare name in later times (see pp. <a href=
        "#Pg222" class="tei tei-ref">222</a> ff.).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally nothing
        concerning Nebuchadnezzar's dreams occurs in the inscriptions of
        Babylonia, though dreams which were regarded as having a
        signification are sometimes recorded. This being the case, it might
        be supposed that something upon the subject would in all probability
        be sooner or later found. But what we should expect to find in the
        extant inscriptions of Nebuchadnezzar is a reference to the golden
        image, threescore cubits high and six cubits wide, which he is said
        to have set up in the plain of Dura. Had he erected such an enormous
        thing, even if it had been merely gilt, and not of solid gold, one
        would expect that he would at least have made a slight reference to
        it. That he may have set up images of his gods is not only possible,
        but probable—indeed, he must have dedicated at least a few during his
        long <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page404">[pg 404]</span><a name=
        "Pg404" id="Pg404" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> reign, but it is
        evident that none of them was of sufficient importance to cause him
        specially to refer to it in his inscriptions. It is therefore not
        impossible that there is some exaggeration in the dimensions of the
        figure referred to in Daniel. There is also considerable uncertainty
        as to the position of the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.
        The most probable explanation is that of Prof. J. Oppert, the veteran
        Assyriologist, who found what appeared to be the base of a great
        statue near a mound known as Dúair,<a id="noteref_120" name=

        Babylon. It is not improbable, however, that <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon,”</span>
        means simply an extensive open space near one of the great
        fortifications (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        principal officials of the kingdom should be expected to come to the
        dedication of such an image is exceedingly probable.</p>

        Daniel referring to Nebuchadnezzar which receives the best
        illustration from the inscriptions is that referred to after the
        relation of his second dream, where he is represented as walking in
        or upon his palace, and one may imagine that he had gone up to enjoy
        the view of the city, and whilst doing so, with almost justifiable
        pride the words, <span class="tei tei-q">“Is not this great Babylon,
        which I have built for the royal dwelling-place, by the might of my
        power and the glory of my majesty?”</span> escaped him. From his
        inscriptions (and they are fairly numerous) we learn, with regard to
        Babylon, that it owed most of its glories as they then existed to
        this, the greatest of its kings. That the king did not always
        distinguish between what he built and what he rebuilt—indeed, none of
        his predecessors seem to have done so either, a circumstance probably
        due to the poverty of the Akkadian <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

        Nebuchadnezzar, Nabopolassar had built (= rebuilt) the two great
        walls of Babylon, called Imgur-Bêl and Nemitti-Bêl. He had dug the
        great city-moat, and raised two strong walls on its banks, similar,
        in all probability, to what other kings had done before him. To all
        appearance also he lined the banks of the Euphrates with embankments
        (probably the quays of which Herodotus speaks), and constructed,
        within the city, a road leading from Du-azaga, <span class=

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these
        erections Nebuchadnezzar completed or altered and improved. He added
        to the defences which his father had built, and raised the level of
        the street Aa-ibur-sabû from the <span class="tei tei-q">“glorious
        gate”</span> to the gate of Istar. The raising of the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“festival-street”</span> necessitated the raising of the
        gateways through which it ran. Gates were made of cedar covered with
        copper, probably after the style of the great gate found by Mr.
        Rassam at Balawat in Assyria, which was adorned with bands of bronze
        chased with scenes of Shalmaneser II.'s warlike exploits in relief.
        In all probability there were but few gates in Babylon of solid
        metal, notwithstanding that there is no mention in Herodotus of their
        having been constructed merely of wood covered with ornamented strips
        of bronze. The thresholds of these gates were of bronze, probably
        similar to that of which a part was found by Mr. Rassam at Borsippa
        (evidently the doorstep of one of the entrances to the temple called
        Ê-zida), and which may now be seen at the British Museum. These and
        other portals at Babylon were guarded by images of bulls and
        serpents, also of bronze. In <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page406">[pg 406]</span><a name="Pg406" id="Pg406" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> addition to this, Nebuchadnezzar built a wall
        on the east side of the city, high like a mountain, so that no enemy
        could approach. Access to the city was gained by gates, the doors of
        which were likewise of cedar ornamented with bronze. For further
        protection, he <span class="tei tei-q">“caused great waters like the
        volume of the sea to surround the land,”</span> and to cross them was
        <span class="tei tei-q">“like the crossing of the broad sea, the Salt
        Stream”</span> (the Persian Gulf). He then rebuilt the palace of his
        father, its walls having been undermined by the waters of the
        Euphrates, which ran near. Advantage of the changes made in this
        building was taken to raise the gateways, which had become too low in
        consequence of the raising of the festival-street of Merodach. In
        addition to this, he built another palace, adjoining that of his
        father, decorating it with cedar, cypress, and other precious woods;
        gold, silver, and precious stones; and adorning it with sculptures
        and with gates overlaid with bronze. According to the India-House
        inscription of Nebuchadnezzar, the fabric of this building was
        completed in fifteen days, a fact so remarkable that it is specially
        mentioned by Berosus (see Josephus, <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Antiquities</span></span>, x., xi. 1), whose
        word may be taken as proving the translation of the passage in
        question. Besides restoring the temples of the cities, or at least
        the principal ones, he restored all the chief temples of Babylonia,
        notably that at Sippar, the chief centre of the Sun-god worship, and
        the great temple-tower dedicated to Nebo at Borsippa. This last,
        indeed, was one of the works upon which he prided himself most, as is
        proved by the fact that it is mentioned in all his inscriptions,
        including those on his bricks, along with the temple known as
        Ê-sagila (later pronounced Ê-sangil), the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“temple of Belus,”</span> which he calls <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the tower of Babylon,”</span> the principal shrine of
        which seems to have been called <span class="tei tei-q">“the House of
        the Foundation of Heaven and Earth,”</span> indicating clearly the
        estimation in which the Babylonians held <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page407">[pg 407]</span><a name="Pg407" id="Pg407" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> it (see p. <a href="#Pg138" class=
        "tei tei-ref">138</a>). It was there that the god Merodach, the
        principal deity of the Babylonians, and the founder of the temple in
        question, was worshipped.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But one might go
        on for a long time describing what Nebuchadnezzar did for the city
        which, more than any other, he loved, and to which he brought the
        spoils of his many expeditions. There is no doubt that this, the last
        great king of Babylon, was a most successful ruler, of whom his
        people were proud. He was pious, and an intense lover of his
        country—two characteristics which endeared him, the one to the
        priesthood, the other to the people at large. Could we but find the
        real history of his reign, it would undoubtedly prove to be full of
        interest, and also of enormous importance, not only on account of the
        light that it would throw upon Jewish history during his period, but
        also on account of its bearing upon a most important epoch in the
        life of the Babylonian nation.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is noteworthy
        that, in Herodotus, many of the great architectural works of his
        reign are attributed to Nitocris, who, he states, was the mother of
        Labynetus (Book I. 185-188). Now, who this Labynetus was, is clear
        from the statement that it was he against whom Cyrus marched—namely
        the Nabonidus of other Greek historians, and the Nabû-na'id of the
        inscriptions. Nitocris would therefore seem to have been the name of
        the queen of Nebuchadnezzar, and if so, it shows upon what grounds
        Nabonidus claimed the throne, and how Belshazzar, in the Book of
        Daniel, could be described as the son or descendant of
        Nebuchadnezzar. But in this case Nitocris must have been another wife
        of Nebuchadnezzar, and not the Median princess whom he had married
        when young. If she supplanted Amytis, Nebuchadnezzar's Median wife,
        in the affections of her husband, it is easy to see how she could
        have feared a Median invasion, as indicated by Herodotus.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nebuchadnezzar
        died in the year 561 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, leaving <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page408">[pg 408]</span><a name="Pg408" id="Pg408"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> his crown to Awēl-Maruduk, the
        Evil-Merodach of 2 Kings xxv. 27, and the Abilamarōdachos of
        Josephus, who, however, also gives, in his book against Apion (i.
        20), the genuine Babylonian form as transcribed by Berosus, namely,
        Eueilmaradouchos. Two other sons of Nebuchadnezzar are also mentioned
        in the contract-tablets of his reign, namely, Marduk-šum-uṣur (in his
        fortieth year) and Marduk-nadin-âḫi (forty-first year). (See pp.
        <a href="#Pg434" class="tei tei-ref">434</a>, <a href="#Pg435" class=
        "tei tei-ref">435</a>.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The substitution
        of the mild rule of Evil-Merodach for the vigorous government of his
        father must have been witnessed by the Babylonians with considerable
        misgiving, for in the East, especially at that period, the successful
        ruler was he who was the most energetic. There is every reason to
        believe, however, that the character of Evil-Merodach was that of a
        man in every way kind and considerate, as is shown by the fact, that
        he released Jehoiachin (whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken prisoner),
        spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above those of the other
        vassal kings in Babylon. The only thing, according to Josephus,
        recorded about him by Berosus was, that <span class="tei tei-q">“he
        governed public affairs lawlessly and extravagantly”</span>—words
        which imply that he displeased the priestly class, of which Berosus
        was one. His name appears in certain contracts (published by Mr.
        Evetts) as ruler of Babylonia for about two years, from the 26th of
        Elul of his accession year to the 4th day of Ab of his second
        year—about two years and five months in all. According to Berosus, he
        was slain by his sister's husband, Nēriglissöoros, the
        Nergal-šar-uṣur of the inscriptions, who then ascended the
        throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The name is the
        same as that given as Nergal-sharezer in Jer. xxxix. 3, 13, one of
        the princes of the Babylonians who was present at the taking of
        Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar, and who at that time bore the title of
        Rab-mag, which is to all appearance the Rab-mugi of the
        Assyro-Babylonian inscriptions. It is <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page409">[pg 409]</span><a name="Pg409" id="Pg409" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> thought by many, and is not by any means
        improbable, that the Nergal-sharezer of the passage referred to and
        the Nergal-šar-uṣur of Babylonian history are one and the same,
        though there is no evidence that the latter ever bore the title of
        Rab-mag.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It was in the year
        559 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> that Evil-Merodach was
        murdered, and Neriglissar at once seized the throne of his
        brother-in-law. Berosus (as quoted by Josephus) gives no details as
        to his reign. In his inscriptions he states that he was (like
        Nabopolassar and Nebuchadnezzar before him) patron of Ê-sagila and
        Ê-zida, the temple of Belus at Babylon and that of Nebo at Borsippa,
        and that the great gods had established his dominion. After speaking
        of the god Nebo, he makes a reference to Ura, the god of death,
        which, under the circumstances, one can hardly regard as otherwise
        than significant—</p>

        his father as <span class="tei tei-q">“king of Babylon”</span> was a
        statement somewhat removed from the truth. In the contract-tablets of
        the time of Nebuchadnezzar and Evil-Merodach, where the name of
        Neriglissar occurs somewhat frequently as a purchaser of houses,
        land, etc., he is called simply <span class="tei tei-q">“son of
        Bêl-šum-iškun,”</span> without any other title whatever (see p.
        <a href="#Pg438" class="tei tei-ref">438</a>). But perhaps
        Neriglissar's statement is due to some historical event of which we
        are ignorant.</p>

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> fourth year of his reign, and was succeeded by
        his son Labāši-Marduk, the Labarosoarchod of the Greek writers.
        According to Berosus (Josephus against Apion, i. 20), he was no more
        than a child, and it may be supposed that he was a younger son of
        Neriglissar, though concerning this we have no information. He only
        reigned nine months, a plot having been laid against him by his
        friends, and he was tormented to death, <span class="tei tei-q">“by
        reason of the very ill-temper and ill practices he exhibited to the
        world”</span> (Berosus). After his death, according to the same
        historian, the conspirators met, and elected one of their number,
        Nabonnedus (Nabuna'id), as king. <span class="tei tei-q">“In his
        reign it was that the walls of the city of Babylon were curiously
        built with burnt brick and bitumen,”</span> is all that Berosus has
        to say with regard to the sixteen years of his reign which preceded
        his overthrow.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Many inscriptions
        of the reign of this king exist, and we are able to gain from them an
        excellent idea of the state of the country and the historical events
        of this important period. All that Nabonidus tells us concerning his
        origin is, that he was the son or descendant of Nabû-balaṭ-su-iqbî,
        whom he calls <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

        faithful servant he professed to be, protesting against the treatment
        which he had received at the hands of certain men who were hostile to
        him. If both these letters were written by the same person, they must

        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> (the eponymy of
        Aššur-naṣir, which is mentioned in one of them). As that was about
        one hundred years before Nabonidus came to the throne, this
        personage, if related to him, must have been his grandfather or
        great-grandfather. Other persons of the same name are mentioned in
        the fifth, eleventh, eighteenth, and thirty-fourth years of
        Nebuchadnezzar, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page411">[pg
        411]</span><a name="Pg411" id="Pg411" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> but
        it seems very unlikely that the father of Nabonidus should be one of
        these.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to the
        Babylonian Chronicle, Nabonidus was at the beginning of his reign
        engaged in the west, to all appearance cutting down, among other
        things, trees on Mount Amanus for building purposes at Babylon.
        Something also took place by the Mediterranean (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">tâmtim ša mât
        Amurrî</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the sea of the land of
        Amoria”</span>). Apparently he had also troops in this district, and
        sacrifices were performed there.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After this there
        is a gap until the sixth year of his reign, the entry for which,
        however, refers wholly to Astyages' operations against Cyrus, and its
        disastrous results, for he was made prisoner, Ecbatana sacked, and
        the spoil brought to Anšan, Cyrus's capital.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Previous to this,
        as Nabonidus informs us in his cylinder-inscription found by Mr.
        Rassam at Abu-habbah (Sippar), the Medes had been very successful in
        their warlike operations, and had even besieged Haran, making it
        impossible for Nabonidus to carry out the instructions of his god
        Merodach, revealed to him in a dream, to restore the temple of Sin in
        that city. On the king of Babylon reminding the deity of the state of
        things in that part, and speaking of the strength of the Median
        forces, he was told that in three years' time their power would be
        destroyed, which happened as predicted. He now caused his
        <span class="tei tei-q">“vast army”</span> to come from Gaza and
        elsewhere to do the needful work, and when completed, the image of
        the god Sin was brought from Babylon, and placed in the restored
        shrine with joy and shouting. Naturally the Babylonian king was
        overjoyed at the release of Haran from the power of the Medes—could
        he have foreseen that Cyrus, their conqueror, would one day hurl him
        from his throne, his enthusiasm concerning the success of
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the young servant of Merodach”</span> (as he
        calls him) would have been greatly abated.</p><span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page412">[pg 412]</span><a name="Pg412" id="Pg412"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In his seventh and
        eighth years the king was in Temâ, and the crown prince (apparently
        Belshazzar is meant), with the great men and the army, was in Akkad
        (the northern part of Babylonia, of which the city of Agad or Agadé
        was the capital). The king did not go to Babylon, Nebo did not go to
        Babylon, Bel did not go forth, the festival <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">akitu</span></span> (new year's festival) was
        not performed, though the victims seem to have been offered in
        Ê-sagila and Ê-zida as usual, and (the king) appointed a priest
        (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">uru-gala</span></span>) of the weapon (?) and
        the temple. In the ninth year also the same state of things existed,
        and this year the mother of the king died, to the great grief of the
        people. It is also recorded for this year that Cyrus, apparently in
        the course of one of his military expeditions, crossed the Tigris
        above Arbela.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the fact that
        the religious processions and ceremonies are given as being
        unperformed every year from the seventh to the eleventh of his reign,
        it is clear that a great deal of discontent was caused thereby, as
        is, in fact, indicated by the cylinder-inscription of Cyrus detailing
        under what conditions he himself entered Babylon. It was evidently
        one of the duties of the Babylonian kings (and, as we have seen, the
        Assyrian kings conformed to this when they became kings of Babylonia)
        to perform the usual ceremonies, and the ruler neglecting this was
        certain to fall into disfavour with the priesthood, and, by their
        influence, with the people as well.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whatever may have
        been the sins of omission of Nabonidus—whether they were trivial or
        otherwise—there is no doubt that they made a bad impression on the
        people, and gave rise to all kinds of statements against him when the
        days of misfortune came. For the scribe who drew up Cyrus's record
        after the taking of Babylon, all Nabonidus's doings with regard to
        the temples and statues of the gods were to be quoted against him.
        The temple dues had <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page413">[pg
        413]</span><a name="Pg413" id="Pg413" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        been allowed to fail, and the gods quitted their shrines, angry at
        the thought that Nabonidus had brought foreign gods to Šu-anna (a
        part of Babylon). With regard to this last accusation, it may be
        remarked that a popular ruler would in all probability have been
        praised for bringing the gods of other places to Babylon—it would
        have been either a tribute to the power of Babylonia in war (a power
        conferred upon her, in their opinion, by her gods); or else the
        payment of homage by the gods of other cities to those of Babylon,
        acknowledging at the same time their (and her) supremacy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The fact is,
        Nabonidus was either the most intelligent, or one of the most
        intelligent, men in Babylonia. To all appearance he was not a ruler,
        but a learned man, full of love for his country and its institutions,
        and desirous of knowledge, which he obtained at all costs. Whenever
        he had to restore a temple, he at once excavated in its foundations
        for the records of early kings which he knew to be there, and he was
        often successful in finding what he wanted. As he always recorded
        what he found, his cylinder-inscriptions nearly always possess a
        value far beyond those of other kings of Babylon. He seems to have
        delighted in what he saw when engaged in this work—he not only tells
        you that he read the texts thus discovered, but he refers to their
        perfect condition, and nearly always says something about the ruler
        who caused them to be placed in the foundations. He, too, is worthy
        of a statue in every place where the language of his native land is
        studied.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally, his
        antiquarian researches, necessitating, as they did, the destruction
        of a part of the fabric of the temple under repair at the time, were
        not looked upon altogether with favour by the priests and the people,
        hence the dissatisfaction to which the scribes, who were probably of
        the priestly caste, afterwards gave vent. Besides this, was it not
        necessary that <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page414">[pg
        414]</span><a name="Pg414" id="Pg414" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        they should justify themselves for accepting a foreign ruler, of a
        different religion from their own?</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Nabonidus gives no
        hint in his inscriptions that he was aware of any dissatisfaction at
        what he was doing. In all probability he was as religious as any of
        his predecessors had been, and his son Belshazzar was as the second
        ruler in the kingdom. Records exist showing that Belshazzar sent
        offerings to the temple at Sippar whilst he was in that
        neighbourhood, and the king's own offerings are sometimes mentioned
        with them. The king had therefore a good deputy performing his work.
        With regard to the bringing of foreign gods to Šu-anna, Cyrus's
        scribe probably refers to the deities of Haran, which were taken
        thither before the siege of the place by the Medes. When the enemy
        had departed, Nabonidus restored the temple in that city, and
        replaced the deities referred to in their shrines. The transport of
        the idols may have been merely to place them for the time being in a
        place of greater security.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There is, then,
        every probability that Belshazzar, son of Nabonidus, was the real
        ruler. What an excellent understanding existed between him and his
        father may be gained from the inscription which Nabonidus caused to
        be composed to place in the foundations of the temple of the Moon
        (the god Sin) at Ur (identified with Ur of the Chaldees), the
        concluding lines of which run as follows—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The text being
        undated, there is no means of ascertaining in what year the
        restoration of the temple of the Moon at Ur took place.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The story of the
        downfall of the Babylonian empire and the end of native rule in
        Babylonia is told by the Babylonian Chronicle as follows—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“(Year 17th), Nebo to go forth (?) from Borsippa ... the
        king entered the temple E-tur-kalama. In the month (?) ... and the
        lower sea, revolted ... went (?). Bêl went forth, the festival Akitu
        (new year's festival) they held as usual (?). In the month ... the
        gods (?) of Marad, Zagaga and the gods of the city of Kiš, Beltis and
        the gods of Ḫursag-kalama, entered Babylon. At the end of the month
        Elul the gods of the land of Akkad who were above the atmosphere and
        below the atmosphere entered Babylon, the gods of Borsippa, Cutha,
        and Sippar did not enter. In the month Tammuz Cyrus made battle at
        Opis on the Tigris among the soldiers of Akkad. The people of Akkad
        raised a revolt; people were killed; Sippar was taken on the 14th day
        without fighting. Nabonidus fled. On the 16th day Ugbaru (Gobryas),
        governor of the land of Gutium, and the soldiers of Cyrus entered
        Babylon without fighting—after Nabonidus they pursued (?), he was
        captured in Babylon. At the end of the month the regiment (?) of the
        land of Gutium surrounded (?) the gates of Ê-sagila (the temple of
        Belus). A celebration (?) of anything, in Ê-sagila and the shrines,
        was not being made, and a (lunar ?) festival was not proceeding.
        Marcheswan, the third day, Cyrus descended to Babylon; they filled
        the roads before him. Peace was established to the city—Cyrus
        promised peace to Babylon, all of it. Gubaru (Gobryas), his governor,
        appointed governors in Babylonia, and from the month Kisleu to the
        month Adar the gods of the land of Akkad, whom Nabonidus had sent
        down to Babylon, returned to their places. The month <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page416">[pg 416]</span><a name="Pg416" id="Pg416"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Marcheswan, the night of the 11th day,
        Ugbaru (Gobryas) (went?) against ... and the son (?) of the king
        died. From the 27th of the month Adar to the third of the month
        Nisan, there was weeping in Akkad, all the people bowed down their
        heads. On the 4th day Cambyses, son of Cyrus, went to
        Ê-nig-ḫad-kalama-šummu (<span class="tei tei-q">‘the house where the
        sceptre of the world is given,’</span> the temple of Nebo). The man
        of the temple of the sceptre of Nebo....”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(The remainder is
        mutilated, and the sense not clear—to all appearance it refers to
        religious ceremonies and sacrifices in which Cambyses took part.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here, again, the
        suggestion seems to be, that because the king thought fit to send the
        statues of the various gods of the land to other cities than their
        own <span class="tei tei-q">“on a visit,”</span> as it were, the
        priesthood was justified in renouncing allegiance to him (and in this
        the people naturally followed them), and in delivering the kingdom to
        a foreigner. It has been said that the success of Cyrus was in part
        due to the aid given to him by the Jews, who, sympathizing with him
        on account of his monotheism, helped him in various ways; but in all
        probability he could never have achieved success had not the
        Babylonian priests (as indicated by their own records) spread
        discontent among the people.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">More important,
        however, are the details of the conquest by Cyrus. He must have
        entered Babylonia on the north-east, and met the Babylonian army at
        Opis. That the conflict went against the Babylonians may be taken for
        granted, though it is not stated. Apparently the country was divided
        into two parties—those for resistance, and those who were probably
        discontented on account of the king's reputed unorthodoxy. A conflict
        between these took place, and there was bloodshed, the result being
        that no resistance could be offered to the army of Cyrus, who entered
        Sippar, the seat of the worship of the <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page417">[pg 417]</span><a name="Pg417" id="Pg417" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Sun-god, without fighting. To all appearance
        Nabonidus was at his post, but recognizing that all was lost, fled.
        Two days later Gobryas (not Cyrus, be it observed) entered Babylon
        with the army of Cyrus without fighting, and apparently captured
        Nabonidus there. This took place about the end of June, and it was
        October before Cyrus entered the city. Judging from the text, he was
        well received, and the result of the conference between him and
        Gobryas was, that the latter <span class="tei tei-q">“appointed
        governors in Babylon,”</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">“in
        Babylonia,”</span> as the words may be also read. Another stroke of
        policy was the return to their habitations of the images of the gods
        which Nabonidus had transferred to other places, thus appeasing the
        priests.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">At this point come
        some very important and difficult phrases. On the night of the 11th
        of Marcheswan, Gobryas descended (or went) upon or against something,
        and the king, or the son of the king, died. The combination of these
        two statements, taken in connection with the record in Daniel v. 30,
        suggests that the latter reading is the correct one, though the
        first, which would make it to mean that the king was slain, is not
        excluded, and would make very little difference in the record, it
        being possible that Belshazzar, as the successor of Nabonidus, might
        be meant. An earlier explanation was, that the doubtful group stood
        for <span class="tei tei-q">“the wife”</span> of the king, but in
        this case it would be difficult to explain how it is that the verbal
        form (which is ideographically written, and may be read either
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">imât</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“he
        dies,”</span> <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tamât</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“she dies,”</span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">mêtat</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“she died”</span>) should differ from that used in the
        case of the king's mother, where <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">imtût</span></span>, the historical tense of the
        secondary form of the kal, is the form used. The use of <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">imât</span></span>
        for <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">imût</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“he
        died,”</span> would be paralleled by the use of <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">irab</span></span>
        or <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">irub</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“he
        entered,”</span> in other parts of the inscription.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally, in a
        case of doubt, the seeker after truth in the matter of Babylonian
        history consults the record <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page418">[pg
        418]</span><a name="Pg418" id="Pg418" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> of
        the Babylonian historian Berosus. In the case of the taking of
        Babylon, however, there are such noteworthy differences, that one may
        well be excused for doubting his statements, notwithstanding his
        trustworthiness in other matters. He says that when Nabonnedus saw
        that Cyrus was coming to attack him, he met him with his forces, was
        beaten, and fled with a few of his troops to Borsippa. Cyrus then
        took Babylon, and gave order that the outer walls should be
        demolished, the city having proved very troublesome to him, and cost
        him much pains to capture. He then proceeded to besiege Nabonnedus in
        Borsippa, but the Babylonian king decided not to attempt to resist,
        and yielded. Cyrus therefore treated him kindly, and though he would
        not allow him to remain in Babylonia, he gave him Carmania as a place
        where he might dwell. <span class="tei tei-q">“Accordingly Nabonnedus
        spent the rest of his time in that country, and there
        died.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Babylonian
        Chronicle, however, says nothing about Nabonidus having taken refuge
        in Borsippa, nor of his being besieged there, nor of his having
        submitted at that place. On the contrary, he was taken in Babylon,
        which city had been captured without fighting, and there was on that
        account no immediate excuse for demolishing the walls, which, as
        native records tell us, were dismantled in the time of the Seleucidæ.
        The fact is, Berosus did not wish it to be thought that the
        Babylonians had allowed their country to pass into the hands of a
        foreign ruler without resistance, hence this statement as to the
        capital holding out. To all appearance, Berosus is truthful where it
        is not to his interest to be otherwise.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The probability
        is, therefore, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the son of the
        king,”</span> Belshazzar, held out against the Persians in some part
        of the capital, and kept during that time a festival on the 11th of
        Marcheswan, when Gobryas pounced upon the place, and he, the rightful
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page419">[pg 419]</span><a name="Pg419"
        id="Pg419" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Chaldean king, was slain, as
        recorded in Daniel. In this case, Darius the Mede ought to be
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Gobryas of Gutium,”</span> who, like the
        former, appointed governors in Babylonia, and <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“received the kingdom”</span> for Cyrus. If this be the
        case, Daniel would seem to have been in Belshazzar's power, though
        his knowledge of what was going on on the Persian side gave him
        courage to reject that prince's favours with scorn.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Officially,
        Belshazzar is never mentioned as king, though the Jewish captives
        must have regarded him as such, and probably spoke of him humorously
        as being the true ruler. This alone can account for his being called
        <span class="tei tei-q">“king of the Chaldeans,”</span> and for his
        appointing Daniel to be the <span class="tei tei-q">“<em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em>
        ruler in the kingdom,”</span> as has been already suggested. That he
        was also confused with his father is shown by the statement in
        Josephus, where he is spoken of (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Antiq.</span></span> x.
        xi. 2) as being called Nabonidus by the Babylonians (<span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Baltasaros, who by the Babylonians was called
        Naboandelos”</span>), though Josephus's transcription of the names is
        as incorrect as a Greek's.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cyrus now found
        himself master of Babylonia, without any pretender to molest him; and
        being the acknowledged ruler of the land, he made himself as popular
        as he could by protecting the various religions which were to be
        found in his new dominions. The Jews are said to have sympathized
        with him on account of his being a monotheist, but to the Babylonians
        he seemed to be of the same religion as themselves, and his
        inscriptions show that, whether with his consent or not, the gods of
        the Babylonians were spoken of and invoked on his behalf just as if
        this were the case, and we know that he allowed his son to take part
        in the Babylonian religious ceremonies.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But to show
        clearly the way in which Cyrus ruled, a portion of his
        cylinder-inscription, found by Mr. Rassam at Babylon, is given

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Here follow the
        ends of nine more lines, from which, however, no certain sense can be
        gained.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be seen,
        that this interesting and valuable inscription is in substantial
        agreement with the Chronicle. The grievance concerning the
        transference of the statues of the divinities is repeated and
        amplified, and the fact that Cyrus entered Babylon without fighting
        is confirmed (against Berosus, Xenophon, and the other Greek authors
        who describe the taking of Babylon).</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Cyrus, however,
        here appears before us in quite a new character, namely, as the
        champion of Babylonian religious orthodoxy against Nabonidus's
        heterodoxy! <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page423">[pg
        423]</span><a name="Pg423" id="Pg423" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        That Cyrus was ignorant of the contents of this inscription (which
        must have been written by his orders) is in the highest degree
        improbable. That he may have been affected by Zoroastrian monotheism
        is likely, but if so, it was but a thin varnish, for he was to all
        appearance a polytheist at heart, as his Anzanian fathers (who, as we
        know from recent discoveries at Susa, were largely influenced by the
        religion of Babylonia) had been from the earliest times. He had
        chosen well the time of his invasion, as is shown by the revolt
        (apparently against Nabonidus) which is referred to in the Chronicle.
        It is strange how the Babylonians were in the main ready to accept a
        new ruler. In the earliest times we have mention of the Arabic
        dynasty which the native records call the dynasty of Babylon; later
        on came Cassites, Elamites and Assyrians, and now the country
        received an Elamite king who ruled over Persia. In the course of time
        other aliens would come and rule over them, but their acceptance of
        these was much less a matter of choice, or, rather, of apathetic
        acquiescence than on the occasion when they accepted Cyrus king of
        Anšan.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">We see, moreover,
        from this inscription, that Cyrus did restore the various exiles to
        their homes, thus securing as far as possible the fidelity of those
        whom he wished to secure as his supporters. Among these were the
        Jews, and it is on account of this that his name is so favourably
        mentioned in the Old Testament. Cyrus himself says, that he caused
        all the gods whose statues had been brought to Babylon to be returned
        to the places whence they had come, and it is clear that, as the Jews
        had no divine statues, Cyrus did what he could for them, and sent
        back to Jerusalem the sacred vessels (Ezra i. 7), and also gave a
        grant for the rebuilding of the Temple (Ezra iii. 7). In the decree
        quoted in Ezra (i. 2 ff.), where he is represented as saying that
        <span class="tei tei-q">“the Lord God of heaven”</span> <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page424">[pg 424]</span><a name="Pg424" id="Pg424"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> had given him all the kingdoms of the
        earth, it is best to see in that, as in his Babylonian
        cylinder-inscription, a desire, for policy's sake, to be <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“all things to all men.”</span> His success must have
        been largely due to the fact, that he had learned the art of ruling
        men.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is to be
        supposed that he continued as he had begun, and that his rule was
        tolerated by the people. According to the contract-tablets, he
        associated his son with him on the throne during part of his first
        year, Cambyses becoming king of Babylon, whilst Cyrus retained the
        wider title of <span class="tei tei-q">“king of countries.”</span>
        Probably Gobryas had died, hence this change. Cyrus died in 529
        <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, and Cambyses took the
        throne. During his reign the Babylonians seem to have become
        discontented, desiring, perhaps, to have a ruler elected by
        themselves. Whilst, therefore, Cambyses was absent in Egypt, which
        country he conquered in the year 527 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, a Median, who was a
        Magian named Gomates, taking advantage of the dissatisfaction which
        prevailed, gave out that he was Bardes or Smerdis (called by the
        Babylonians Barzia), declared himself the son of Cyrus, whom Cambyses
        had murdered, and mounted the throne. Media, Persia, and Babylonia at
        once went over to him, and Cambyses hastened from Egypt to meet the
        pretender. Whilst in Syria, on the way home, he killed himself (521),
        perhaps by accident, though it is not impossible that it was a case
        of suicide, and the pretender retained for a very short period
        possession of the throne.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another prince of
        the same family, Darius son of Hystaspes, now came forward, and after
        defeating Bardes and a number of other pretenders, among them
        Nidintu-Bêl, son of Aniru, who claimed to be Nebuchadnezzar the son
        of Nabonidus, mounted the throne. In fact, almost every province of
        the Persian empire had a pretender of its own, so that Darius found
        plenty of work ready to his hand. One by one, however, they were
        defeated, and <span class="tei tei-q">“the lie”</span> was put
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page425">[pg 425]</span><a name="Pg425"
        id="Pg425" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> down in all the countries
        acknowledging Persian rule—Darius was sole and undisputed king.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is unfortunate
        that no historical records referring to the reigns of Cyrus and
        Cambyses exist, except the Chronicle, which, however, ends with the
        accession year of the former. We have, therefore, no independent
        records of what took place in Syria, though it must be confessed,
        that there is great doubt whether the composer of the Chronicle at
        the time would have considered the return of the Jews and the
        rebuilding of the Temple as of sufficient importance to place on
        record there. The Bible and Josephus give circumstantial accounts of
        what occurred, but the official view of the circumstances of the
        granting of the permission to rebuild the Temple and the city by
        Cyrus, and its countermanding, at the instance of the Samaritans,
        during the reign of Cambyses, would be interesting in the
        extreme.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To find something
        about Zerubbabel, who is said to have been the friend of Darius
        (Jos., <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ant.</span></span> xi. iii. 1), would also be
        welcome, but this we can hardly dare to hope for. Zerubbabel (better
        Zeru-Babel, without the doubling of the <em class=
        "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></em>) is a
        name which is far from uncommon in the contracts of Babylonia. One,
        for instance, lived during the time of Nabonidus, and dwelt at
        Sippara. He was to all appearance of Assyrian origin. Another, the
        descendant of a smith, was the father of a man named Nabû-âḫê-bulliṭ,
        who lived in the third year of Darius. A third bearing the same name
        is he who is recorded as having acquired some ewes in the eleventh
        year of Darius. His father bore the unusual name of Mutêriṣu. For yet
        another example, see p. <a href="#Pg441" class="tei tei-ref">441</a>.
        It will thus be seen that the name was far from rare in ancient
        Babylonia.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And in the
        published contract-tables of Darius's reign, of which nearly 600 have
        been made available for study, there is little bearing upon Old
        Testament history. The same may also be said of his historical
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page426">[pg 426]</span><a name="Pg426"
        id="Pg426" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> inscriptions, of which that
        engraved on the great rock at Behistun in Persia is the most
        important. It is in his historical inscriptions, however, that the
        character of the man may be read. In the first lines, where he tells
        of his origin, you read of his pride of descent, just as, farther on,
        he tells the story of his conflicts—how, with the help of his father,
        Hystaspes, who seconded him loyally and (there is hardly any doubt)
        affectionately, he overcame all the rebels, and having annihilated
        the lie which he hated so intensely, he could say, after his
        successes, that <span class="tei tei-q">“the land was
        his.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And through it all
        shines at every point, as it were, his adoration of the god whom he
        worshipped, Ahuramazda, by whose grace and favour he had been
        successful. There is no doubt about his religious faith—in his
        inscriptions he appears as a monotheist of the severest type, and for
        this reason he must have had but little sympathy with the polytheism
        of the Babylonians, and the other nationalities over which he ruled,
        whose faith was in a plurality of gods. It is true that offerings
        seem to have been made in his name in the temples of Babylonia, but
        these must have been due to old grants which had not been rescinded,
        and which the king and his advisers probably would have regarded as
        bad policy to abolish.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally there is
        every probability that such a ruler as Darius would have sympathies
        with the Jews, on account of their monotheism, and it may be supposed
        that such a feeling towards them would have led him to consent to the
        upholding of Cyrus's decree that the Temple at Jerusalem should be
        finished, as detailed in Ezra vi. 1 ff. Darius relates in the
        Behistun inscription, that he restored the temples of the gods (Bab.

        ša îlāni</span></span>, Median <span class=

        pseudo-Bardes <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page427">[pg
        427]</span><a name="Pg427" id="Pg427" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> or
        Smerdis, had destroyed. That a single word (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">āyadāna</span></span>) is used in Persian,
        whilst the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">“temples of the
        gods,”</span> in the plural, is used in Babylonian and Median, shows
        merely the desire to speak to the latter nations in the language to
        which they were accustomed, and at the same time indicates that
        neither the one nor the other, unlike the Persians, were monotheists.
        Gomates was therefore not a monotheist, otherwise he would not have
        destroyed the temples, which would seem to have been those of
        Darius's own faith; for this king would hardly have thought it worth
        while to mention the fact of their destruction, had they been the
        sacred places of a creed which he despised, and it is only natural to
        suppose, from his very frequent mention of Ahuramazda, the god whom
        he worshipped, that he was proud of being a monotheist.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It may therefore
        be taken, that if Darius Hystaspis ordered the completion of the
        Temple at Jerusalem, and the giving of funds in aid of the work, it
        was out of sympathy with the Jews. As his reign was one of tolerance,
        he did not interfere with the religion of either the Babylonians or
        the Medians, but in all probability he did not imitate Cyrus by
        grants on his own account, and under a royal decree, to the temples
        of those, to him, heathen countries. There is considerable doubt,
        however, whether it is this king who is referred to in Ezra and
        Esdras, as Sir Henry Howorth has shown (<span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Proceedings of the
        Society of Biblical Archæology</span></span>, 1901, pp. 147 ff., 305
        ff., 1902, pp. 16 ff.), the ruler intended being in all probability
        Darius Nothus, whose position agrees with the chronology of these
        books, and does away with much difficulty as to their acceptance as
        historical authorities.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">According to
        Darius, twenty-three countries owned his sway: Persia, Elam,
        Babylonia, Assyria, Arabia, Egypt, <span class="tei tei-q">“by the
        sea,”</span> Sarpada, Ionia, Media, Armenia, Cappadocia, Parthia,
        Drangiana, Aria, Chorasmia, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page428">[pg
        428]</span><a name="Pg428" id="Pg428" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        Bactria, Sogdiana, Paruparaesana, Scythia, Sattagydia, Arachosia, and
        Maka. Palestine was evidently included in the district designated
        <span class="tei tei-q">“by the sea.”</span> After a most active
        reign, Darius died in the year 486 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, having appointed his
        son Xerxes as his successor.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The reign of this
        ruler, and his attempt to reduce Greece to submission, are well
        known. It was probably after his disastrous failure, when he had
        returned to Persia, that he took as one of his wives the Jewess
        Esther, as related in the book bearing her name. His inscriptions are
        short ones, referring to the buildings erected by his father and
        himself. In all probability he thought that his warlike exploits,
        overwhelmed as they were by misfortune, were not of a nature to bear
        recording. In his own inscriptions, his name is given as Ḫiši'arši or
        Ḫiši'arša'i in Babylonian, and Khshayarsha in Old Persian. In the
        contract-tablets, however, it appears as Aḫšiaršu, Aḫšiwaršu,
        Akšiaršu, Akkašiaršu, and Ḫišiarši. It is from one of the forms with
        prefixed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">a</span></em> that the Hebrew Aḫashwērôs (A.V.
        Ahasuerus) has apparently come, the most probable original being one
        similar to the Aḫšuwaršu of a contract-tablet in the Museum at
        Edinburgh.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Xerxes died in the
        year 464 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, and was succeeded by
        his son Artaxerxes, the Artakhshatra of the Old Persian inscriptions,
        and the Artakšatsu or Artakšassu of Babylonian inscriptions. Though
        it was not without bloodshed that he reached the throne, he proved to
        be a successful ruler—more so, in fact, than his predecessor, whose
        expedition against the Greeks had ended only in disgrace and the loss
        of an enormous number of troops taken from all the nations over which
        he ruled. It is therefore not to be wondered at that his reign should
        have been regarded as wise and temperate. In any case, he was well
        disposed towards the Jews, and gave permission, in his seventh year,
        to Ezra, to go up to Jerusalem with a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page429">[pg 429]</span><a name="Pg429" id="Pg429" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> royal grant, to settle affairs there, and
        sacrifice to the God of the Jews (Ezra vii., viii.). Later on, he
        gave permission to Nehemiah to return to the land of his fathers to
        restore and rebuild the walls of the city. As Nehemiah was his
        cupbearer, it is easily conceivable that he did this to please him,
        and to reward one who had evidently been a faithful servant, but it
        is not improbable that the king at the same time had in his mind the
        rebellion of his general Megabysus, who had risen against him in
        protest against the treatment meted out by his royal master to his
        captive Inarus. To have a well-fortified city defended by those who
        had benefited greatly by his rule, must have seemed to the Persian
        ruler good policy.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Artaxerxes died in
        the year 425 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, and was succeeded by
        his son, Xerxes II., who reigned only two months, at the end of which
        time he was murdered by Sogdianus, a bastard son of Artaxerxes, who
        then became king. Seven months only, however, was the length of this
        new ruler's reign, he being, in his turn, put to death by another of
        the bastard sons of Artaxerxes, Darius Ochus, after he had
        surrendered to him. This ruler is the Darius Nothus of history, who
        mounted the throne in 424 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> His reign was noted for
        the numerous insurrections against his dominion which took place, but
        is of special interest because of the resumption of the work of
        rebuilding the Temple of Jerusalem, which had been stopped by the
        decree of Artaxerxes, as recorded in Ezra iv. 21-24. (See Sir H.

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If
          trade-activity be a test of prosperity, then the Babylonians of the
          period extending from the end of the reign of Nabopolassar to the
          end of that of Darius could have had but little to complain of on
          the whole, notwithstanding the changes of dynasty which took place.
          Over three thousand inscriptions covering this period have been
          published, and there is every reason to believe that, if all the
          texts in the various museums were made known, twice this number
          might be reached. There is, therefore, an abundance of material
          with which to reconstruct the life of that period. Naturally, many
          of this enormous number of inscriptions are comparatively
          uninteresting, and some of the texts are of little or no value,
          even to specialists. This being the case, it will easily be
          understood that, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page431">[pg
          431]</span><a name="Pg431" id="Pg431" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
          as they are mostly of the nature of contracts, with a certain
          number of legal documents, the information which many of them give
          is comparatively meagre, and there is a great deal of repetition.
          That some of them, notwithstanding these disadvantages, are
          sufficiently interesting, will be seen from the examples which this
          chapter contains.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among all these
          documents we find repeated, with some differences which the course
          of centuries had brought about, the same transactions, and the same
          daily life as has already been treated of in the fifth chapter, pp.
          <a href="#Pg159" class="tei tei-ref">159-191</a>. There are
          purchases and sales of land, property, and slaves, loans at
          interest and without interest, and all the various kinds of
          contracts which the daily needs of a large population call forth.
          Marriage-contracts and contracts of apprenticeship are also not
          uncommon, wills and divisions of property—generally in greater
          detail than of old—are also to be found. To these must be added the
          leasing and hire of houses, the purchase and hire of ships,
          divisions of property, inventories of the same, receipts of
          different kinds, etc. etc.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">For the most
          part, the people who pass before us are slaves, servants,
          money-lenders, merchants, and other of the common folk, with a
          sprinkling of scribes, priests, both of the higher and the lower
          classes (generally the latter), palace officials, now and then a
          judge, or a governor, or one of the subordinate officials. Did we
          know them all, perhaps we should think more of them, and estimate
          them at their true worth; but in the appearance and reappearance of
          their names we see only the plaintiff or the defendant, the buyer
          or the seller, and it is but rarely that we can recognize them as
          men of note, though in many cases it is to be conjectured that they
          were so. It is only seldom that the crown prince or one of his
          brothers, appears, or a relative of the ruling king comes within
          our range—as for the king himself, except in the date of a
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page432">[pg 432]</span><a name=
          "Pg432" id="Pg432" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> document, his name
          is rare in the extreme, and when he appears actively, it is in the
          character of patron of the temples, or something of a similar
          nature.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally the
          king was hedged about with a considerable amount of reverence,
          which must have manifested itself in many ways which we shall
          probably never know. This consideration for the name of the king
          would lead to his being represented by an agent, doing away with
          the necessity of his appearing in person, when dealing with his
          subjects. Though he prudently keeps out of sight, it is hardly a
          dignified thing that the great Nebuchadnezzar should appear as a
          moneylender, even by proxy, as he seems to do in the following
          document. But we do not know the whole history of the transaction,
          so must not hastily accuse him of an unkingly action—his appearance
          may be unauthorized, or the loan may be capable of a perfectly
          natural explanation.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“Ten shekels (in) ingots (?), the silver of
          Ina-êši-êṭir, son of Nadin, the king's agent. The king's silver,
          which was given for gold (? = as capital) to Ina-êši-êṭir, (is) due
          from Nabû-êṭir, son of Šulâ, descendant of the mead-dealer. At the
          end of the month Tisri he will give (it) back. His property, as
          much as there is, (is) the security, until Ina-êši-êṭir receives

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Though security
          is referred to, there is no mention of interest, but Ina-êši-êṭir
          probably expected something of the kind. The question also arises,
          whether the sum may not have been advanced without the authority of
          his royal master. The original of the expression translated
          <span class="tei tei-q">“ingots”</span> suggests that the pieces
          may have been in the form of a sword-blade.</p><span class=

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
          tablets referring to Nebuchadnezzar's offerings, 84-2-11, 23, and
          its duplicate 270 of the same collection, are probably the most
          interesting. This inscription is to the effect that Izkur-Marduk
          had given up with willingness the office of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">naš-paṭrūtu</span></span> to
          Nabû-balaṭ-su-iqbî. His duty was to perform the king's sacrifices
          every year before the goddess Išḫara, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“dwelling in Ê-ša-turra, which is within
          Šu-anna,”</span> and before Pap-sukal, of <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“the temple Ê-kidur-kani, the house of the Lady of
          heaven, of the bank of the water-channel of <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">âlu-eššu</span></span> (the new city) which is
          within Babylon.”</span> The animals sacrificed were oxen and sheep,
          and the parts offered before the two deities are fully specified.
          The contract ends with a longer curse than usual in tablets of this
          class: <span class="tei tei-q">“Whoever the words and this gift
          changes, as much as has been conferred (?) on Nabû-balaṭ-su-iqbî,
          may Merodach, Zēr-panitum, Išḫara, and Pap-sukal bespeak his
          destruction; may Nebo, the scribe of Ê-sagila, shorten his long
          days. The spirit of Marduk, Zēr-panitum, (and) his gods, and
          Nabû-kudurri-uṣur, the king their lord, they have invoked.”</span>
          The names of three witnesses and the scribe follow this, after
          which is the date, 29th day of Tammuz, 32nd year of Nebuchadnezzar.
          A portion of the sacrifices were to be made on the 8th day of
          Nisan, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> at the beginning of the
          second week of the new year.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As stated in his
          long inscriptions referring to the restoration of the temples at
          Babylon, Nebuchadnezzar looked upon that city as the one whose
          temples he especially delighted to honour, and this text referring
          to his offerings seems to bear out that statement. As, however, his
          inscribed cylinders from other places show that he did not neglect
          the shrines of his provincial capitals altogether, so certain
          inscriptions referring to his offerings elsewhere show that he did
          not withhold what was considered as due from him to the other
          shrines of his realm. Thus, in his thirty-fifth <span class=
          "tei tei-pb" id="page434">[pg 434]</span><a name="Pg434" id="Pg434"
          class="tei tei-anchor"></a> year he is recorded to have made a gift
          or offering of an object, made or set with some kind of stone, to
          the goddess of Sippar, Aa, the consort of the Sun-god, and another
          object of gold to the god himself. In all probability, the text
          referred to is only one of a number of inscriptions referring to
          the king's offerings, for even this great and popular ruler would
          hardly have dared to risk the hostility of the priests merely to
          gratify his desire to enrich and embellish his capital city. In
          addition to the king, the officials of his court sometimes made
          offerings at Sippar, as is indicated by the following short
          inscription—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
          "tei tei-q">“One ass, tithe which Nabû-šarra-uṣur, the king's
          captain, has given to the temple Ê-babbara. Month Iyyar, day 20
          less 1, year 42nd, Nabû-kudurri-uṣur, king of Babylon.”</span></p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all
          appearance, Nabû-šarra-uṣur was a man sufficiently well off, if, as
          may well be supposed, he possessed nine other asses besides the one
          which he was giving as tithe. From the nature of the offering, this
          could not have been made on account of the king, though he must
          from time to time have commissioned others to act on his behalf, as
          the following inscriptions inform us that his sons did—</p>

          inscription, dated in the forty-first year of Nebuchadnezzar,
          refers to another son, named Marduk-nadin-aḫi, whose servant,
          Sin-mâr-šarri-uṣur, had paid half a mana for fruit (dates). The
          name of the servant, which means <span class="tei tei-q">“Moon-god,

          to the devotion of the family of its owner to the royal house.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These references
          to the sons of Nebuchadnezzar naturally raise the question of the

          Nebuchadnezzar. As this is a historical point of some importance,
          even the most uncertain light, when thrown upon it, may turn out to
          be of considerable value. In all probability, therefore, this is

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will
            probably seem strange to most readers that Babylonian parents,
            who were as a rule fond of children, should sell their son; but
            it is impossible to pronounce judgment against them without
            knowing more, so as to be able to take into consideration the
            circumstances in which the thing was done. Though the document
            resembles those recording the sale of slaves, certain phrases are
            left out (compare the inscriptions referred to on pp. <a href=
            "#Pg465" class="tei tei-ref">465</a> ff.).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            exclamatory addition of the scribe in one case, where he writes
            the name of the mother, Ḫulîtum, with the prefix for divinity,
            shows that he regarded her as being with the gods—to all
            appearance she had, at the time of making the copy, departed this
            life. It may be taken as implying respect, reverence, and
            something more.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page437">[pg
            437]</span><a name="Pg437" id="Pg437" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally
            there is no suggestion that the Nabonidus who is given as the
            first witness, with the title <span class="tei tei-q">“he who is
            over the city,”</span> was the son of Nabû-balaṭ-su-iqbî,
            afterwards king of Babylon. The scribe of the second tablet calls
            him <span class="tei tei-q">“the son of the king,”</span> but
            there is no indication, from Babylonian sources, that he was one
            of the sons of Nebuchadnezzar. It is true that, in Daniel,
            Belshazzar is spoken of as if Nebuchadnezzar was his father (or,
            better, grandfather), but this is the first indication that the
            Babylonians ever thought of Nabonidus, his father, as one of the
            sons of the great Nebuchadnezzar. The question is, whether the
            scribe who made the second and more incorrect copy would have
            read into the doubtful characters which his original evidently
            contained, a statement which he must have known to be untrue,
            incorrect, or impossible. In view of the fact that the copy in
            question must have been made sufficiently near to the time of
            Nabonidus for the facts to be still known, a wilful error is to
            all appearance excluded, though, on the other hand, the
            incorrectness of other parts of the tablet obliges us to take the
            statement for what it is worth. The traces of a character after
            the words <span class="tei tei-q">“son of the king”</span> are
            doubtful—they look like the remains of three horizontal wedges,
            the two lower ones being fairly clear. As the topmost wedge is
            the most doubtful, it is possible that the traces which remain
            are really part of the sign for <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“city,”</span> in which case the scribe wrote
            <span class="tei tei-q">“son of the king of the city,”</span>
            placing the determinative prefix for <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“man”</span> before the character for <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“king”</span>—a most unusual way of writing the word.
            It enables us to surmise, however, that the reading of his
            original was really <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">ša muḫḫi âli</span></span>, instead of
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ša
            êli âli</span></span> (both phrases have the same meaning), that
            he regarded <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">ša</span></span> as <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">a</span></span>, that he thought
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">muḫ-ḫi</span></span> to be the characters
            for <span class="tei tei-q">“man”</span> and <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“king,”</span> and that he read the last of the
            phrase, the character for <span class="tei tei-q">“city,”</span>
            correctly.</p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page438">[pg

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They are a
            couple of as interesting, but, at the same time, as
            unsatisfactory, tablets, as could well be imagined.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is to be
            noted that the name of Nabonidus is not altogether uncommon in
            the inscriptions. In most cases, however, we know that it is
            either not the well-known king of that name, or that his identity
            with him is doubtful. That the person here referred to was a man
            of some consequence is indicated by his title, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“he who is over the city,”</span> and it often
            happens in that case (as here) that the name of his father and
            other remoter ancestor is omitted. This is sometimes the case
            with Neriglissar, who is very often named in the contract-tablets
            of Babylonia, and his name is then either given without any
            indication of his parentage, or else with the simple addition
            <span class="tei tei-q">“son of Bêl-šum-iškun.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another figure
            which appears at this time is that same Neriglissar who was to
            play so important a part in the affairs of Babylonia at a later
            date. In the case of this prince (unlike the Nabonidus of the
            inscription translated above) we are not tormented by any doubts
            whatever. It is really and truly Neriglissar, and none other. He
            first appears in Nebuchadnezzar's thirty-fourth year, in the
            following legal document—</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Neriglissar
            must therefore have been an extensive cattle-owner, and had many
            servants, some of whom at least must have been men of substance,
            like Abî-nadib, who engages to restore to his master the 100
            sheep, if it could be proved that they had been lost by his
            fault. Judging from the name, Abî-nadib (= Abinadab) must have
            come from the west, his Biblical namesakes being Israelites.
            Nabû-ṣabit-qâtâ elsewhere appears as the major-domo of the crown
            prince (? Laborosoarchod = Labâši-Marduk) during the reign of
            Neriglissar, and of Belshazzar during the reign of his father
            Nabonidus. The reader will meet his name again in the

            transaction to the above is one in which two servants of

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all
            appearance prince Neriglissar was a very busy man, who sought to
            add to his worldly goods by every means in his power, and did not
            disdain to engage in trade in the attainment of wealth. What he
            had apparently begun in the reign of Nebuchadnezzar, he continued
            in the time of Evil-Merodach, during whose reign there are
            several inscriptions referring to his transactions with regard to
            houses. In the first of these inscriptions he hires a house for
            11 mana of silver from Nabû-âbla-iddina, by his agent,
            Nabû-kain-âbli (first year of Evil-Merodach, month and day
            lost).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In another
            contract he acquires 4 canes, 1 cubit, 8 fingers (of land) from
            Marduk-šakin-šumi, and 2 canes, 6-2/3 cubits from
            Kurbanni-Marduk, for a total of 4 mana 19 shekels of silver.
            (Babylon, month Tebet, day 9th, 1st year of Evil-Merodach.)</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the third
            contract it would seem that the property in land of
            Nabû-âbla-iddina had been given over to his creditors, of whom
            Nabû-banî-âḫi was one, the amount due to him being, in all, 53
            shekels of silver, due to him from Nabû-âbla-iddina in the name
            of a third party. By the authority of Neriglissar it would seem
            that 42-1/3 shekels of silver were paid to Nabû-banî-âḫi, who
            then gave to Neriglissar a contract for 53 shekels of silver,
            promising, at the same time, to speak to the king's scribes, and
            draw up and deliver to Neriglissar a <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">sealed</span></em> document. If he did not
            do this, he was to be liable for the silver and its interest.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By advancing
            the money to this creditor, Neriglissar became himself a creditor
            of the estate of Nabû-âbla-iddina (15th of Adar, 1st year of
            Evil-Merodach), and it seems to have been his intention to get
            the whole <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page441">[pg
            441]</span><a name="Pg441" id="Pg441" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            of the land and the houses thereon into his own hands. He
            therefore acquired further interest in the property a few weeks
            later (26th of Nisan, 2nd year of Evil-Merodach), and again after
            a further interval of three months (14th of Tammuz, 2nd year of
            Evil-Merodach). To all appearance, the amounts advanced by
            Neriglissar to the creditors of the estate were less than the
            sums due to them from Nabû-âbla-iddina on account of their
            claims. He seems, however, to have got them to give him receipts
            in full, and they had to promise to deliver sealed documents. He
            must have made a considerable profit out of this species of
            bill-discounting.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The last
            tablet referring to the estate of Nabû-âbla-iddina is dated in
            the accession year of Neriglissar's own reign (9th of the 2nd
            Adar), and in this Nabû-âḫê-iddina secures an interest by paying
            26-¼ shekels of silver on account of a sum of 52-½ shekels—just
            half. The land is stated to have been <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“sold for silver for a palace,”</span> and the money
            was paid by the intermediary of Nabû-âḫê-iddina, Neriglissar's
            representative in such matters before he ascended the throne. The
            following is a translation of this interesting document—</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But
            Neriglissar was now king, and had no need and but little desire
            to appear before his subjects as a purchaser of houses, or as a
            trader in any way (it is probably on this account that his name
            does not occur in the above document). When he engaged in
            anything of the kind, it was henceforth through agents. The only
            exception known is the marriage-contract of his daughter Gigîtum,
            who espoused the high priest of Nebo at Borsippa. The following
            is a translation of this document, as far as it is preserved—</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The mutilation
            of the record is unfortunate, as the conclusion of the matter
            cannot be ascertained, but it may be regarded as fairly certain
            that Neriglissar really did give his daughter Gigîtum in marriage
            to Nabû-šum-ukîn, for had it been otherwise, there would have
            been but little need to draw up the document of which the
            fragment here translated <span class="tei tei-pb" id=

            "tei tei-anchor"></a> has been preserved to us. The remainder of
            the tablet was probably taken up with the usual conditions—the
            penalty Nabû-šum-ukîn would have to pay should he divorce or
            abandon his wife; the penalty Gigîtum would have to suffer if she
            disowned or forsook her husband; directions with regard to the
            amount and disposal of her dowry, etc. This and similar
            inscriptions seem to suggest that Herodotus was probably wrongly
            informed with regard to the compulsory nature of the public
            prostitution of unmarried women which, he says, was practised in
            Babylonia, the expressions found in these inscriptions often
            pointing, as in the present case, to a belief, on the part of the
            bridegroom, in the chastity of the woman chosen by him to be his
            wife.</p>

            according to Berosus, Laborosoarchod (Labāši-Marduk) was a mere
            child when he came to the throne, there is no doubt, from the
            inscription which follows, that he was old enough to have an
            establishment of his own, and also to carry on the business of
            money-lender, Nabû-ṣabit-qâtâ (see p. <a href="#Pg439" class=

            transactions in which he engaged. As it is an inscription typical

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">What the crown
            prince did, it goes without saying that all the court officials
            sought to do. An instance of this is Bêl-âḫê-iddina, the king's
            captain, who is recorded as having lent 2/3 of a mana of silver
            to Ardîa and Šulâ, at an interest of one shekel upon every mana
            monthly—twenty per cent. yearly—a sufficiently high interest,
            though it was the usual rate in Babylonia. This inscription is
            dated at Babylon, 7th day of Kisleu, 2nd year of Neriglissar. It
            is noteworthy, however, that there is no mention of interest in
            the document drawn up for Labāši-Marduk's major-domo.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Interesting is
            the inscription in which two partners engage to meet two other

            with regard to two <span class="tei tei-q">“lines”</span> of
            leather goods (9th day of Tammuz, 3rd year of Neriglissar). It
            also furnishes further testimony to the fact that this prince had
            a separate establishment.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">After
            Laborosoarchod's nine months came the reign of Nabonidus, whom,
            as will be remembered, the Babylonians and Cyrus, his conqueror,
            accused of neglecting the gods, and sending them forth from their
            shrines to the cities around. Perhaps his crime consisted in his
            preference for the gods of other cities than Babylon, the city
            which Nebuchadnezzar's lavish favours had somewhat spoilt, and
            who resented her neglect at the hands of the antiquarian king.
            However that may be, contemporary records show that he gave to
            the benefit of Sippar, the city of the Sun-god, not unfrequently.
            A mutilated inscription refers to full-grown oxen and sheep from
            the son of the king, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page445">[pg
            445]</span><a name="Pg445" id="Pg445" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            for the king's sacrifices, divided between two temples at Sippar,
            one of them being that of Anunitu[m] (7th of Adar, 9th year of
            Nabonidus); and things from the <span class=

            nidinit šarri</span></span> (<span class="tei tei-q">“warehouse
            of the king's gifts”</span>) are often mentioned. Naturally he
            had to make gifts to many shrines in Babylonia.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether the
            following refers to oxen for sacrifice or not is doubtful—</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

            "font-style: italic">gur</span></span> of grain, shows that
            Nabonidus was fairly liberal to the temples at Sippar. It is also
            very probable that he provided for the needful repairs of this
            and other temples from time to time, one of the inscriptions
            (dated in his third year) recording a contribution of half a
            talent and 7 mana of silver for work done on the great
            temple-tower of Sippar, <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page446">[pg

            Ê-babbara, besides 8 mana 20 shekels of silver as tithe,
            seemingly for grain for the city Ḫaburu, where, it is to be
            conjectured, an agricultural farm belonging to one of the temples
            of Sippar was situated.<a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133"

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is not by
            any means improbable that Nabonidus had a residence at Sippar,
            and if so, this would explain the reason of his favouring that
            city, and at the same time add to the causes of the discontent of
            the <span class="tei tei-q">“sons of Babylon.”</span> This is
            implied by a small tablet apparently inscribed with an account of
            the receipts and expenditure of the temple Ê-babbara at Sippar,
            which occupied the position of purveyor of water, and took the
            place of the water-company of the cities of modern Europe—</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
            tablet, dated in Nabonidus's accession year, indicates that the
            temple supplied water, for a fixed sum, to a part of Sippar
            called <span class="tei tei-q">“the city of the Sun.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From other
            tablets we obtain also information <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page447">[pg 447]</span><a name="Pg447" id="Pg447" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> about the family of Nabonidus. Most of
            them, as is to be expected, refer to Belshazzar, the heir to the
            throne, who is conjectured to have been the second ruler in the
            kingdom, thus explaining how it was that the position of
            <span class="tei tei-q">“third ruler in the kingdom”</span> could
            be offered to the Prophet Daniel. Like the other rulers of
            Babylonia, Nabonidus had granted to Belshazzar, or at least
            permitted him to occupy, a separate house, which was situated
            within Babylon, beside the house of Marduk-îriba, son of Rêmut,
            descendant of Miṣrâa. From the inscription referring to this
            which has come down to us, it may be conjectured that
            Marduk-îriba was a minor, and his sister, Bau-êṭirat, therefore
            acted for him. Bêl-rêṣūa, servant of Belshazzar, approached her
            and succeeded in acquiring her brother's land for 45 shekels of
            silver, which was duly paid to Marduk-îriba. Though it is not
            stated, this transaction probably took place on behalf of
            Belshazzar, who wished to add to his possessions, and as it is
            dated in the month Adar, in the 1st year of Nabonidus, it would
            seem that he decided to enlarge the domain he was entitled to as
            crown prince shortly after he found himself occupying that
            position.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another tablet
            referring to Belshazzar is a contract drawn up for one of his
            secretaries (on the one hand), by which he obtained the
            occupation of a house in exchange for a loan of silver—a common
            arrangement in those days in Babylonia. The following translation
            will enable the reader to see the terms of this, the type of a
            numerous series of documents—</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The house of Nabû-âḫê-iddina, son of Šulá,
            descendant of Êgibi, which is beside the house of Bêl-iddina, son
            of Rêmut, descendant of the <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">dikû</span></span>, (is granted) for 3 years
            to Nabû-kain-âḫî, secretary of Bêl-šarra-uṣur, the son of the
            king, for 1-½ mana of silver. He has let (it) upon (the condition
            that) <span class="tei tei-q">‘there is no rent for the house,
            and no interest for <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page448">[pg
            448]</span><a name="Pg448" id="Pg448" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            the money.’</span> He shall repair the woodwork and renew the
            dilapidation of the house. After 3 years, the silver, 1-½ mana,
            Nabû-âḫê-iddina shall (re)pay to Nabû-kain-âḫi, and Nabû-kain-âḫi
            shall leave the house in the possession of
            Nabû-âḫê-iddina.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Here follow
            the names of three witnesses and the scribe, after which comes
            the date: <span class="tei tei-q">“Babylon, month Nisan, day
            21st, year 5th, Nabû-na'id, king of Babylon.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the 1-½
            mana of silver would have brought in 18 shekels at the usual rate
            of interest, that sum may be taken as representing the rent of
            the house in question.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another
            inscription, dated two years later, shows that Nabû-kain-âḫi,
            Belshazzar's secretary, borrowed 35 shekels of silver from
            Nabû-ṣabit-qâtâ, that prince's major-domo, to purchase a slave,
            and that the loan was duly repaid. The curious thing in
            connection with this transaction is, that the money advanced is
            stated to be <span class="tei tei-q">“tithe of Bêl, Nebo, Nergal,
            and the lady (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Ištar) of Erech,”</span>
            implying that Nabû-ṣabit-qâtâ was entitled to certain sums from
            this source, or else that he had control of them, and could
            advance money to others therefrom. Information concerning all the
            items of income and expenditure of the temples would probably
            furnish interesting reading, showing, as it should, who were the
            people who benefited from the funds available, and upon what
            grounds.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is
            noteworthy that, in these inscriptions referring to transactions
            between the members of Belshazzar's household, no interest seems
            to have been charged on the loans granted; and if this was really
            so, it indicates a considerable amount of loyalty among these men
            towards each other—indeed, it is doubtful if it could be
            surpassed at the present day.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Strangest of
            all these contracts in which Belshazzar is mentioned, is probably
            that in which the prince himself seems to appear as one of the
            contracting <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page449">[pg
            449]</span><a name="Pg449" id="Pg449" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            parties—as a dealer in clothes. As it is the only one referring
            to him thus, a translation of the inscription in question is here
            given in full—</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

            his slave, and his property in town and country, all there is, is
            the security of Bêl-šarra-uṣur, the son of the king, until
            Bêl-šarra-uṣur receives his money. (For) the silver, as much as
            (from the sum) is withheld, interest he shall pay.</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">But Belshazzar
            did not confine himself to dealing in woollen stuffs or clothes,
            as many another inscription indicates. This was but an
            unimportant incident in his life which chance has preserved to
            us, and how far the transaction may have taken place with (or
            without) his own knowledge, it is impossible to say. For a
            considerable time, however, he was with the army in Akkad, and
            whilst there, he interested himself greatly in the welfare of the
            temples at Sippar, making donations to them, not only on his own
            behalf, but also for his father. Thus, on the 11th of Iyyar, in
            the 9th year of his father's reign, he <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page450">[pg 450]</span><a name="Pg450" id="Pg450" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> gave to the god Šamaš a tongue of gold
            weighing one mana; and on the 7th of Adar of the same year he
            gave two full-grown oxen for sacrifice (his father gave one on
            that occasion), together with fourteen sheep, and in addition
            other sacrifices were made on his and his father's behalf in the
            temple of the goddess Annunitum. The following little
            inscription, being rather out of the common, is probably above
            the average in the matter of interest—</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

            inscription is defective in places, there is every probability
            that little or nothing more than the name of the god is wanting.
            The name of Bêl-šarra-(bulliṭ) shows that the inscription must
            belong to the time of Nabonidus, and, in fact, the initial wedges
            of his name are visible.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The name of a

            picture these and the historical inscriptions give of the
            Babylonian royal family is not altogether unpleasing, and that
            this king, with his son, were the last rulers of their race, is
            greatly to be regretted. But, alas, they had offended the
            priesthood of Babylon, and all the people accepted, without a
            murmur, the alien ruler, of a differing faith from theirs, who
            presented himself, in hostile array, at their doors. It was the
            beginning of the end of their life as a nation, and who shall say
            that they did not deserve it? If they had made even a show of
            resistance, the world could hold them excused, but this was not
            the case, as their own records show, and whatever Nabonidus's
            faults may have been, they do not attain to the culpability of
            the nation, which, instead of protecting him—if for no other
            reason, it ought to have done this for his son's sake—practically
            betrayed him to the enemy.</p>

          "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of</span></em> the
          people—those engaged in the life-struggle <span class="tei tei-pb"
          id="page452">[pg 452]</span><a name="Pg452" id="Pg452" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> of which every great city is the battlefield,
          and has been the battlefield since the first gathering of large
          bodies of men in one place.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Who among us can
          estimate the misery caused by the tearing away of the slave from
          the home of the master with whom he had for many years dwelt in
          content?—it must have far outweighed the few cases in which a slave
          in those days benefited by such a change. That the loss of his
          slaves was sometimes also a wrench to the owner is indicated by the
          fact that he is generally—if not always—made to say, that he parts
          with them cheerfully. He had to admit this for the satisfaction of
          the buyer, who naturally feared that the old master would return
          and ask for the contract to be annulled, saying that it was all a
          mistake on his part—he did not really wish to get rid of them, and
          would like to have them back again.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Naturally the
          tablets do not reveal to us all this, nor the joys and sorrows, the
          successes and the failures, which those great cities of the ancient
          East must have contained. But they allow us to guess a great deal.
          Did the man ever get the money back which he had lent? Did he
          receive the money for the things he had sold and given credit for?
          These and other similar questions are always occurring to the
          student of these documents, which reveal always the grave side of
          life in that ancient land—never the gay side—even a wedding, being
          a contract, was a thing much too serious to allow its joyful nature
          to shine through at any point.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the documents
          which best represent the character of the Babylonians are the
          letters, it has been thought well to begin (as in the case of the
          chapter upon the earlier Babylonians) with a few specimens of
          these, and in the forefront the following may be cited as not
          unworthy of a prominent place—</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=

          "tei tei-q">“brother”</span> and <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“brothers”</span> is uncertain, but is very probable.
          In any case, the writer would seem to show considerable courage in
          the course he was taking, as well as confidence in the
          righteousness of his cause.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following is
          apparently the letter of a father in poverty to his more successful

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The change from
          the third person to the second is noteworthy, and may have been
          caused by the necessity of distinguishing between the son and the
          messenger to whom the writer referred. Rêmat was evidently the
          writer's wife.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following is
          a letter of a different nature, and leads to speculations as to the

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Apparently the

          uninteresting. The character of the inscriptions of this class

          following text, which also has an interest because the sender was a
          slave. The original belongs to the collection of tablets acquired
          by the late Sir Cuthbert Peek for his father, the late Sir Henry

          be taken as indicating fairly well the drift of the whole, and thus
          answer the purpose for which it is given, namely, to show what
          texts of this class generally refer to, and how excellently they
          reveal to us the conditions of Babylonian life at the time when
          they were written.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This tablet
          belongs to the reign of Darius Hystaspis, and is addressed to one
          of the most prominent men of Babylon at the time, Širku, otherwise

          was an active man, and his business transactions, which begin, as
          far as we have record of them, in the third year of the king named,
          consist of the usual loans, exchanges, purchases, sales,
          agreements, etc., which exist in large numbers during this period.
          In the third year of Darius he seems to have been in Elam, perhaps
          upon business of state, the name of a high Babylonian official
          being mentioned on the tablet which records this fact. Later on, he
          comes before us as a large owner and dealer in ships, some of
          which, of small size, he seems to have used for the construction of
          a bridge of boats. He owned Dâan-bêl-uṣur, the writer of the tablet
          translated above, Nanaa-bêl-uṣri, his wife, and their six children,
          who dwelt on his property in the city of Šuppatum. On one occasion,
          as recorded on a tablet in the Louvre, they formed part of the
          <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page456">[pg 456]</span><a name=

          "tei tei-q">“the king's captain, son of Idra'.”</span> Further
          references to both master and slave will be found farther on.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">As the tablets
          referring to life at Babylon are exceedingly numerous, and many of
          them have special interesting points of their own, a few selected
          specimens are here translated, and may be regarded as
          characteristic and typical in their class and subject.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It has been
            suggested that the claim of Aqabi-îlu to all his brother's

            the Babylonian law concerning the wife's dowry—<span class=

            that it was her own in any event—being clear and
            incontrovertible. The probability therefore is, that he claimed
            the property hoping that she might not be able to prove her
            right. The clear statements of this document, and the
            common-sense judgment delivered by Nabonidus's judges are full of
            simplicity and dignity, and show well the Babylonian

            have undertaken willingly, and in return, Ikîšā annulled
            Rêmanni-Bêl's adoption, and bequeathed him, as a slave, to
            Ê-sagila-râmat and her daughter. Means probably existed for

            fruit also exists, and is preserved in the British Museum.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Among the
            tablets of the time of Nabonidus, translations of all the records
            known which refer to the family of Ben-Hadad-nathan or
            Abil-Addu-nāthanu have been given, and examination of the
            numerous other tablets of the reigns of his predecessors and his
            successors down to the time of Darius, and perhaps Xerxes, shows
            that similar more or less complete family histories could be
            made. One of the most interesting of these, and the most complete
            on account of the number of documents (by far the greater number
            of the contracts from Babylon and its neighbourhood, of the
            period to which he belongs, contain his name) are those referring
            to Širku, a tablet from whose slave Dâan-bêl-uṣur has been given
            above (p. <a href="#Pg454" class="tei tei-ref">454</a>). This
            man's history has been tentatively dealt with by the present
            author in Part IV. of the catalogue of tablets belonging to the
            late Sir Henry Peek. From a tablet in the Louvre, we find that
            Širku was not his real name, but that he was called
            Marduk-naṣir-âbli. The curious thing about this double naming of
            Širku, however, is that the majority of the tablets where he is
            called Širku say that he was the son of Iddina, and the majority
            of those calling him Marduk-naṣir-âbli say that he is the son of
            Itti-Marduk-balaṭu. Fortunately documents exist <span class=
            "tei tei-pb" id="page468">[pg 468]</span><a name="Pg468" id=
            "Pg468" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> reversing this parentage, and
            showing conclusively that Širku and Marduk-naṣir-âbli are one and
            the same personage. Were it otherwise, we should have to credit
            his slaves with two masters, and his wife with two husbands, a
            state of things probably unknown in Babylonia.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From a tablet
            dated in the first year of Darius, we learn that he bought a
            field before the great gate of Uraš in the province of Babylon,
            this field being beside that of his wife Âmat-Bau, which she had
            brought as her dowry. Other documents record that he made loans
            of silver and produce, both alone and associated with his
            brothers. In these his proper name is generally used, but
            sometimes he was called Širku. The hiring and letting of houses,
            the buying and selling of slaves, etc., are also recorded of
            them. In the third year of Darius he and his brothers came into
            considerable property in Babylon, sharing it among them, and
            there is also record of Marduk-naṣir-âbli paying his father's
            debts. This increase in their resources naturally enabled them to
            deal in the produce of their fields, and in all probability they
            managed his wife's as well, whilst there is at least one record
            that she lent money on her own account. To enumerate all the
            interesting points which the tablets reveal to us concerning
            their various transactions, however, would naturally take too
            much time and space.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In exchange
            for the slave Dâan-bêl-uṣur, the slave's wife, their six
            children, and a cornfield upon the canal called Ṭupašu, which
            Marduk-naṣir-âbli gave to his wife Âmat-Bau, he received from her
            two sums of silver and one of gold, a ring, and two slaves, who
            had been part of her dowry. The slaves he gave her, though now
            her property, were in all probability still at his disposition,
            but Dâan-bêl-uṣur seems to have served him so well when in charge
            of his affairs, that after having parted with him, though only to
            his wife, he must have found, to his regret, that he and his
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page469">[pg 469]</span><a name=
            "Pg469" id="Pg469" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> family were
            naturally not so much at his disposition as when he could call
            them his own.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Under the name
            of Marduk-naṣir-âbli, he appears before us principally in the
            character of an agriculturalist and dealer in produce, combining
            with this money-lending on occasion. As Širku, he dealt largely
            in ships, and apparently also in boats for pontoon bridges. In
            the fifth year of Darius he was in Elam, and there is a reference
            to the sending to him of a messenger, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“with the charioteers of Bêl-âbla-iddina, captain of
            Babylon.”</span> Many years afterwards Širku is said to have
            received the rent of a house situated <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“upon the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">giššu</span></span> of Borsippa,”</span> and
            the question naturally arises, whether <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">giššu</span></span> may not be for
            <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">gišru</span></span>, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“bridge,”</span> though a house upon a bridge
            crossing a comparatively narrow canal near Babylon is certainly
            not what one would expect.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">On the 16th of
            Sivan in the twenty-sixth year of Darius, Širku was the scribe
            who drew up a contract referring to two ships, one apparently for
            service on the Euphrates, the other for the bridge. Later on, he
            borrowed some money upon the security of two of his female
            slaves, Mušêzibtum and Narû, the wrist of the former being
            inscribed with the name of one of his relations, the other with
            his own name, Širku (it is given as Šišku on the tablet). This
            loan is distinctly stated to be for the purpose of acquiring
            <span class="tei tei-q">“a ship for the bridge”</span>
            (<span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">êlippu ša giširi</span></span>), and this he
            seems to have bought two months later, unless there was another
            contract for a vessel which has not come down to us. In the Peek
            collection is a large tablet referring to the completed bridge,
            the traffic upon it, and the ships moored to it, suggesting that
            a portion of it at least was used as a quay or landing-stage.
            More research is needed, however, ere its precise nature will be
            clear—perhaps the etymology is misleading, and <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">gišru</span></span> or <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">giširu</span></span> means, in Babylonian,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“pier”</span> or <span class=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following
            is one of the inscriptions which refer to his hiring a ship—</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The tablets in

            "font-style: italic">alias</span></span> Širku, are mentioned,
            prove that Babylonia maintained its character as a maritime
            nation to a very late date. As, however, voyages on the ocean are
            not provable, it is doubtful whether their ships sailed to any
            great distance—in all probability they confined themselves to
            making coast-voyages only. Judging from the penalty attached to
            taking the ship across the great (water), the question naturally
            arises, whether the sea (the Persian Gulf) may not have been
            intended. The word used in the original is <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">rabbu</span></span>, which would then
            correspond with the last word of the poetic expression,
            <span class="tei tei-q">“the rolling main.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Such, as far
            as space allows, was life at Babylon and the chief cities of
            Babylonia, where the Israelites dwelt for so many years, and
            colonies of them existed until a very late date, as the drinking
            bowls inscribed with charms against sickness and evil spirits in
            Hebrew and Aramaic show. Some of the Hebrew names contained in
            the tablets from Babylonia have already been referred to (p.
            <a href="#Pg458" class="tei tei-ref">458</a>), and to these
            several others may be added, such as Banāwa or Beniah;
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page471">[pg 471]</span><a name=
            "Pg471" id="Pg471" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Gamariāwa or
            Gemariah; Malakiāwa or Malchiah, who had a son bearing the
            heathen name of Nergal-êṭir; together with several
            similarly-formed but otherwise unknown names (as was to be
            expected). Examples of these are, Azziāwa, Ḫuliāwa, Nirîāwa and
            Agirîāwa. The Gemariah mentioned above was witness, with his
            compatriot Barikîa (Berechiah) and others, on the occasion when
            Ša-Nabû-duppu sold Nanaa-silim, his Bactrian slave-girl. The
            scribe's name on this occasion was Marduka (Mordecai), son of
            Épeš-îli. Mordecai means <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            Merodachite,”</span> and is interesting as showing how Babylonian
            monotheism, such as it was, reconciled the Jews to accept what
            they would otherwise have regarded as a heathen name.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Interesting in
            the extreme would it be, if we could know what the Jews thought
            of the country and the city of their captivity. In that enormous
            walled tract known as the city of Babylon were large open spaces
            covered with gardens, and cornfields, and orchards, mostly,
            perhaps almost exclusively, of date-palms, the fruit of which
            formed such an important part of the food of the people. These
            were the trees, in all probability, on which the Jewish captives
            hung their harps when, in their captivity, they mourned for the
            city of Sion, from which they were so far away. The rivers of
            Babylon, of which the well-known psalm speaks, were the Tigris
            and the Euphrates, with the innumerable canals and
            watering-channels which the nature of the country rendered so
            necessary to the fertility and productiveness of the land, and
            without which it would have been a desert.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">There, too,
            they looked upon the buildings of old time, the fanes which were
            there when their forefather Abraham was a dweller in the land,
            changed, doubtless, beyond recognition. Chief among these was the
            great temple of Belus, joined to the tower called <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the temple of the foundation of heaven and
            <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page472">[pg 472]</span><a name=
            "Pg472" id="Pg472" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> earth,”</span> and
            which Nebuchadnezzar speaks of as <span class="tei tei-q">“the
            tower of Babylon.”</span> There, too, were the shrines dedicated
            to Zēr-panitum, consort of Merodach, the goddess Nin-maḫ; Nebo,
            the god of wisdom; Sin, the Moon-god; Šamaš, the Sun-god; Gula,
            the goddess of healing, and many other divinities. Whilst the
            Jews were there, they must have seen many of this king's building
            operations—the strengthening of the fortresses and the walls, and
            the repair and extension of the moats and ditches; the raising of
            the level of the great street, Aa-ibûr-sabû (the remains of which
            have just been found by the German explorers on the site of the
            city), along which, yearly, at the beginning of the year,
            processions went, and the images of the gods were in all
            probability carried. Then there was the rebuilding of the royal
            palace, with its roof and doors of cedar, the latter being also
            overlaid with bronze, probably after the manner of the bronze
            gates of Shalmaneser found by Mr. Rassam at Balawat. The
            thresholds were also of bronze, and the palace was adorned, in
            other parts, with gold, silver, precious stones, and various
            other costly things.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">They must have
            seen, also, the construction, between the two great
            fortifications called Imgur-Bêl and Nē-mitti-Bêl, of that great
            building which was to serve as a castle and a royal residence at
            the same time. This was in connection with the old palace of
            Nabopolassar, Nebuchadnezzar's father, built, as already stated,
            in a fortnight. Chief among the shrines restored by
            Nebuchadnezzar with great magnificence must be mentioned Ê-kua,
            the sanctuary of Merodach, in the temple Ê-sagila (the temple of
            Belus), and that called Du-azaga (<span class="tei tei-q">“the
            glorious seat”</span>), otherwise described as <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“the place of fate,”</span> where yearly, on the new
            year's festival (the 8th and 9th of Nisan) the statue of the god
            Merodach, <span class="tei tei-q">“the king of the gods of heaven
            and earth,”</span> was placed, and the king's future declared on
            the question being put. Doubtless the <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page473">[pg 473]</span><a name="Pg473" id="Pg473" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> glory of the place attracted not a few,
            causing them to decide to stay there permanently, and these,
            mingling with the native population, were lost to Israel, like
            their brethren of the ten tribes, and even as Nergal-êṭir, son of
            Malakiāwa (see above) seems to have been.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding
        the return of large numbers of Jews to Jerusalem, a considerable
        portion of the nation had become attached to the land of their
        captivity, and remained in Babylon and the other cities of Chaldea,
        as well as in Persia. These, no longer captives, but settlers by
        their own free will, had probably decided to stay in the land either
        from the desire to continue the businesses which they had started
        there, the relinquishing of which would have meant, in all
        probability, ruin to themselves and their families; or because of
        aged relatives for whom the journey to Jerusalem, however much they
        might have desired it, would have been an impossibility; or because
        of official and civil positions which they held either at court or in
        the employment of rich or influential personages, by whose support
        they hoped to be able to aid their compatriots; or because of the
        attractions of a great city, whose origins must for them have
        possessed a <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page475">[pg
        475]</span><a name="Pg475" id="Pg475" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        special interest (notwithstanding the horrors of the captivity which
        their forebears must have experienced there), and whose position for
        thousands of years as the capital of a large province gave it a
        preponderating influence, not only in the country of which it was the
        capital, but in all the civilized world at the time.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This being the
        case, there numbers of the Jews stayed, and there they witnessed the
        gradual departure of the sceptre from that city which one of their
        own writers had described as the glory of kingdoms, and the beauty of
        the Chaldees' excellency. After the passing of the kingdom into the
        hands of the alien Persian kings, things went on as usual under their
        rule for a considerable time—the people lived on their land, and
        bought and sold, and transacted their ordinary business, and trade
        seems to have been good (judging from the number of documents which
        have been preserved) until the end of the reign of Darius Hystaspis.
        Thereafter there was either a great falling off, or else the
        documents were deposited in other places, or a more perishable
        material was used for them. In any case, they become comparatively
        scarce, and their rarity may be due to the departure of trade from
        the capital, brought about by the removal of the court from Babylon,
        and the consequent migration of her merchants to other places.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Things had been
        going, in fact, from bad to worse for Babylon, and among the clay
        records left, some of the royal names which we should like to see are
        to all appearance absent. It was still, however, a place of great
        importance, when, in the year 331 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, it opened its gates to
        Alexander the Great, surrendering, like Susa and Persepolis, without
        striking a blow. Doubtless to them it was perfectly indifferent under
        which foreign potentate they lived, and a change in that respect
        could not make their condition worse, and might be to their
        advantage. Had he not died long before the term which nature has
        fixed, the city <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page476">[pg
        476]</span><a name="Pg476" id="Pg476" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        might have taken upon it such a renewed lease of life as would have
        caused it to exist as a great capital to the present day. As it
        happened, the Babylonians began to see their fondest hopes realized,
        for it must soon have become noised abroad that the new conqueror of
        Asia intended to make Babylon his Eastern capital, and they saw the
        clearing away of the rubbish which was the preliminary to the
        restoration of the great and renowned temple of Belus, Ê-sagila (or
        Ê-sangil as they called it at that time), actually proceeding, not
        only during the reign of Alexander, but also during that of his
        successor, Philip, as well. The mental calibre of the latter,
        however, who came to the throne on the death of Alexander in the year
        323 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, must soon have told
        the Babylonians that the realization of his great predecessor's
        schemes was hopeless, and the downward course of the city's star,
        arrested as it were for a moment, soon began again.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The next change of
        rulers was that following upon the unworthy bearing of Antigonus with
        regard to Seleucus, Alexander the Great's favoured general, who had
        espoused his claims to the throne of the Eastern empire. After aiding
        Ptolemy of Egypt against Demetrius, son of Antigonus, he set out with
        a small force, and gathering recruits in his course, especially among
        the Babylonians, with whom he was popular, he entered their capital
        without opposition in 312 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, from which date the
        era of the Seleucidæ is regarded as beginning. How the Babylonians
        took the foundation of Seleucia on the Tigris, which is often
        mentioned in the numerous astrological tablets of this period, is not
        recorded, but from the way in which they speak of the migration of
        the inhabitants of Babylonia to Seleucia implies that they took it
        greatly to heart.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“Blessed shall he be who serveth thee as thou hast served
        us,”</span> sang the Psalmist when lamenting the captivity of the
        Jews at Babylon, and if success in conquest be a sign of blessedness,
        then Seleucus must <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page477">[pg
        477]</span><a name="Pg477" id="Pg477" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        have been happy indeed. The Babylonians could not have regarded the
        continual and increasing desolation of their city with indifference,
        however, and it is not impossible that their loyalty to their king
        suffered somewhat in consequence. This, to all appearance, found vent
        in expressions of regret, and an old lamentation, referring to the
        depredations of the Qutû at a period so remote that we can hardly, at
        this distance of time, estimate, and of which a copy was made for a
        certain Bêl-zēr-lîšir, might well express their feelings at this
        period:</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">By those same
        <span class="tei tei-q">“rivers of Babylon”</span> where the
        Israelites had mourned in captivity, thinking of Jerusalem, there the
        Babylonians themselves came at last to lament the departed glories of
        their land. Many a time, it is true, they had seen the country which
        was their fatherland overrun by enemies, but it had always recovered,
        and risen to a greater height of prosperity. <span class="tei tei-pb"
        id="page479">[pg 479]</span><a name="Pg479" id="Pg479" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> This time, however, there was to be no healing
        of her wound. The large and well-peopled space within the walls of
        the great city gradually became uninhabited, and the houses fell into
        ruin. A time even came at last when the great walls had to be
        demolished—or at least practically so—in order that they might not
        afford protection to the lawless bands which infested the country,
        and were only too ready to make the most of such an advantage.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Notwithstanding
        the desolation of the city, however, a certain number of people
        continued to inhabit the site, probably officials of the temples
        (whose services still continued), and tradesmen who supplied the
        wants of those whose duty held them attached to the place. Here, year
        after year, the usual sacrifices were offered to the old gods of the
        Babylonians, especially <span class="tei tei-q">“My Lord and
        Lady,”</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Bêl (Merodach) and Beltis
        (Zēr-panitum, his consort), and prayers were made for the king at the
        time reigning, and also for his sons (if he had any). That
        inscriptions may come to light which will show more clearly the state
        of things in that vast ruined city is exceedingly probable, and a
        sufficient number of tablets referring to this period are known to
        exist even now, and show in some measure the state of the city and
        the kind of people who dwelt in such parts of it as had been reserved
        for that purpose.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To those who
        inhabited Babylon's desolation, the most important thing, in all
        probability, was the worship, with all the old rites and ceremonies,
        of the deities whose temples and shrines still existed there. But
        those old priests and temple scribes occupied their time in another
        way, namely, the keeping of careful records of every historical event
        for the purpose of being able to tell the future. These historical
        notices are preceded by indications of the positions of the moon and
        the planets, together with the price of grain or other produce,
        during the period referred <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page480">[pg
        480]</span><a name="Pg480" id="Pg480" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> to.
        The positions of the planets, etc., were combined afterwards, by the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“monthly prognosticators,”</span> with the
        historical happenings, for the purpose of foretelling events, which
        at that late period was probably done much more systematically than
        during earlier ages, to the great advantage of the modern student of
        this period.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The following will
        give an idea of these historical notices:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(Month Ab, 143rd

        Epiphanes.)</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“An., the king, marched victoriously among the cities of

        probably meaning <span class="tei tei-q">‘images of gods’</span>) and
        works like a shrine (of?) the Greek(s?)....”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inscription
        then goes on to speak of the appointment of a <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">zazak</span></span> (apparently a grade of
        priests) by the king, the handing to him of the gold in the treasury
        of Ê-saggil for the great (shrine) of Bêl, the (dedication?) of an
        unsuitable or an untimely image of the god Uru-gala on the 8th day of
        the month, and other similar occurrences. From the lines translated
        above, it will be seen that the Babylonians had not by any means
        escaped from the influence of Greek civilization, not only Greek
        words, but also, to all appearance, Greek gods and shrines having
        made their appearance. The word used in speaking of the image of the
        god Uru-gala is <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">tamšil</span></span>, but the things which the
        citizens made were <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">puppē</span></span>, possibly used like our word
        <span class="tei tei-q">“idol.”</span> It is possibly to this period,
        or a little later, that the transcriptions into Greek of Babylonian
        <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page481">[pg 481]</span><a name="Pg481"
        id="Pg481" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> tablets (which promise to be
        of considerable value for the study of the Assyro-Babylonian
        language) belong.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">If the translation
        given above be correct, it would confirm the account in the second
        book of Maccabees (vi. 2), from which it would appear that this ruler
        tried to habituate the Jews to Greek customs, and also to the Greek
        religion, going even so far as <span class="tei tei-q">“to pollute
        also the temple in Jerusalem, and to call it the temple of Jupiter
        Olympus; and that in Garizim, of Jupiter the Defender of strangers,
        as they did desire that dwelt in the place”</span> (vi. 2).
        <span class="tei tei-q">“The abomination of desolation”</span> which
        was set on the altar at Jerusalem (1 Macc. i. 54) is understood by
        commentators to mean an idol-altar, though almost any heathen image
        would suit the sense, and a statue of a god, with or without a
        shrine, might be meant. The reference to Meluḫḫa in all probability
        refers to one of his expeditions to Egypt, and is generally supposed
        to indicate Ethiopia.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another change
        which the Babylonians experienced was when the rule of their Greek
        masters was exchanged for that of the Parthians, and the Seleucidæ
        gave way to the Arsacidæ. Concerning the period of the change, and
        the way in which it came about, very little is known. The varied
        fortunes of the Seleucid princes is illustrated by the fact that a
        satrap of Media named Timarchus, in 161-160 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, had succeeded in
        proclaiming himself king of Babylon; and from 153-139 <span class=
        "tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, Arsaces VI.
        (Mithridates I.) was in possession of all the district east of the
        Euphrates—Babylonia, Elam, and Persia. After his death, however, all
        this portion seems to have returned to the rule of the Seleucidæ, and
        their era was in all probability restored. After the death of
        Antiochus Sidetes, in 129 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, the province of
        Kharacene became independent under a ruler named Hyspasines or
        Spasines, who, two years later, seems <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page482">[pg 482]</span><a name="Pg482" id="Pg482" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> to have made himself master of Babylon. An
        interesting tablet dated in the reign of this king (who used the
        Seleucian era) shows something of the state of things on the site of
        the old city, and that somewhat vividly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">(The inscription

        imperfect, but do not seem to affect the transaction as a whole.)</p>

        "tei tei-anchor"></a> mutilation of the text, not altogether
        satisfactory, certain items of information which it contains will
        hardly admit of doubt. There were still inhabitants of the city,
        there were temple-servants, who were probably under a kind of
        overseer of the works, and these apparently attended to all the
        temples. Whether this man was too old to work or not is doubtful, but
        it would seem that it was considered too much that his sons should
        keep him altogether, hence the drawing up of the document here
        quoted.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is noteworthy
        that, instead of Merodach, or Bêl-Merodach, the god of Babylon, who
        became the chief deity of all Babylonia, a new deity appears, namely,
        Anu-Bêl, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">i.e.</span></span> Anu the Lord, or,
        paraphrased, the Lord God of Heaven, probably the god Merodach
        identified with Anu. The religion of the Babylonians probably
        underwent many changes during this later period, when those who
        belonged to it came into contact with foreigners, many of them most
        intelligent men, whose teaching must have had with them great
        weight.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Another important
        inscription, in the British Museum, gives many details of the period
        of this little-known king, Aspāsinē. From this we learn that the
        Elamites made incursions in the neighbourhood of the Tigris.
        Pilinussu, the general in Akkad, apparently carried on operations
        against another general, and seems to have gone to the cities of the
        Medes before Bāgā-asā, the brother of the king. A man named Te'udišī
        also seems to have opposed the general in Akkad. Yet another
        inscription of the same period states that Ti'imūṭusu, son of
        Aspāsinē, went from Babylon to Seleucia (on the Tigris), showing that
        the former renowned place was still regarded as one of the cities of
        the land. At this time one of the opponents of Aspāsinē's generals
        was <span class="tei tei-q">“Pittit, the enemy, the Elamite.”</span>
        Elam, to its whole extent, was smitten with the sword, and Pittit
        (was slain, or <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page484">[pg
        484]</span><a name="Pg484" id="Pg484" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        captured). Sacrifices were made to Bel, probably on account of this
        victory.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Similar
        inscriptions of the time of the Arsacidean rule in Babylonia also
        exist, and would probably be useful if published. Unfortunately, they
        are all more or less damaged and mutilated, but of those which I have
        been able to make notes of, one may be worth quoting. The following
        extract will show its nature:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“This month I heard thus: Aršakā the king and his
        soldiers departed to the city of Arqania.... (I) heard thus: The
        Elamite and his soldiers departed to battle before the city Apam'a
        which is upon the river Ṣilḫu....”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The remainder is
        very mutilated, and requires studying in conjunction with all the
        other inscriptions of the same class, though even then much must
        necessarily be doubtful.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In many of these
        inscriptions each of the long paragraphs ends with a reference to the
        sacrifices which had been made in the temples of Babylon among the
        ruins, and sometimes, though rarely, they refer to something of the
        nature of an omen. The following will serve as an example:—</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“... descended to Babylon from Seleucia which is upon the
        Tigris. Day 10, the governor of Akkad ... the congregation of
        Ê-saggil, (sacrificed) one ox and 4 lambs in the gate Ka-dumu-nuna of
        Ê-saggil, (and) made (prayer for the lif)e of the king and his
        preservation. On the 5., one ox and 3 lambs (they sacrificed). The
        congregation of Baby]lon came to Ka-dumu-nuna of Ê-saggil, offerings
        like the former ones were made ... went forth from Sippar. This month
        a goat brought forth, and the litter was 15.”</span></p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Contract-tablets,
        some of them of a very late date indeed, within a decade or two of
        the Christian era, show that the temples still existed, and that
        sacrifices and services still went on, probably uninterruptedly, at
        the temples of Babylon, and this implies that, <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page485">[pg 485]</span><a name="Pg485" id="Pg485"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> though the country had no national
        existence, the beliefs of the people survived for many centuries the
        downfall of their power. In all probability, what took place at
        Babylon had its counterpart in other places in the country—the fanes
        renowned of old—as well. Indeed, it is known that, at the most
        perfectly preserved of the temple-towers of Babylonia at the present
        day—that at Borsippa, now and for many centuries known as the Birs
        Nimroud, <span class="tei tei-q">“the tower (as it is explained) of
        Nimrod,”</span>—the services and worship were continued as late as
        the fourth century of the Christian era. The worship of Nebo, the god
        of wisdom, or, rather, letters, had always been extremely popular,
        hence, in all probability, the continuation of his cult until this
        late date. But this was to all appearance the last remnant of the
        powerful and picturesque creed of old Babylon, and details of its
        slow and gradual disappearance from the religious beliefs of the
        world would probably be as interesting as the story of its growth and
        development.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em"><span class=
        "tei tei-q">“The Church at Babylon,”</span> mentioned in 1 Peter v.
        13, is generally understood allegorically, as of the Church in the
        world, or that in the great Babylon of the time when the apostle
        wrote, namely, Rome. Though it is unknown whether a Christian Church
        existed in his time anywhere in Babylonia, it is probably certain
        that the native Christians of Baghdad (and 'Irāq in general) are pure
        descendants of the ancient Babylonians, to whom, in form and stature,
        as well as in character, and their tendency to progress, they have a
        great likeness. The same may be said of the native Christians of
        Assyria.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Could we but know
        the history of Assyria at this period, it is very probable that we
        should find it to resemble in certain things—perhaps in the main—that
        of Babylonia after her downfall. From the religious point of view,
        also, there must have been similarity. They, too, knew the worship of
        the <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page486">[pg 486]</span><a name=
        "Pg486" id="Pg486" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“merciful Merodach,”</span> to them a type of Christ, and
        his father Êa (from whom he obtained the means of helping mankind),
        in name and position a type of Jah, God the Father, whom the
        Christians worshipped. But we shall never in all probability know
        whether they thus analyzed and compared the two faiths, though it is
        very possible that they did, for it is said that the Egyptians were
        attracted to Christianity by the comparison of Christ with their
        Osiris. Such, however, is the tendency of the mind of mankind. Ever
        unwilling to break with the old, he seeks for some analogy in the
        new, to form a bridge whereby to pass to higher things. Minor deities
        have ever tended to become Christian saints, and such may have
        been—indeed, probably was—the case with the Babylonians and the
        Assyrians.</p>

        Laws Of Ḫammurabi.</span></h1>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This monument was
        found at Susa, in the excavations undertaken by the French
        Government, by MM. de Morgan and Prof. V. Scheil. It is a column of
        diorite, measuring about 7 feet in height, tapering slightly from the
        bottom upwards. The circumference of the base is about 2 yards, and
        at the summit about 5 feet 5-½ inches. As, however, the stone is not
        square, it may be described as measuring, roughly, 22 inches broad at
        the base, and 16 inches just above the bas-relief at the top, where
        it is rounded somewhat irregularly.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The bas-relief,
        which is in perfect condition, measures about 2 feet 2 inches in
        height, and represents Ḫammurabi standing, facing to the right,
        towards the sun-god Šamaš, who sits on a throne of the usual recessed
        design. The god is bearded, clothed in a flounced robe, and has his
        hair looped up behind. His hat is pointed, and is adorned with four
        (eight) horns, rising at the side, and coming forward, where their
        points are turned up. His right shoulder is bare, and in his right
        hand he holds a staff and a ring, emblematic of authority and
        eternity, or his apparent course in the heavens. His right hand is
        held against his breast, and wavy lines, probably representing his
        rays, arise from his shoulders.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Ḫammurabi, who
        stands before the seated god, is clothed in a long robe reaching to
        his feet, and held up by his left arm. His right shoulder and arm are
        bare, and the hand is raised as if to emphasize the words he is
        uttering. Like the god, he is heavily bearded. On his head he wears
        the globular thick-brimmed hat distinctive of men in authority for
        many hundred years before his time, and for a considerable period
        afterwards.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inscription,
        which is in horizontal columns, covers all four sides of the stone,
        and is divided into two parts, called by <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
        "page488">[pg 488]</span><a name="Pg488" id="Pg488" class=
        "tei tei-anchor"></a> Prof. Scheil, who first translated it, the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“obverse”</span> and the <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“reverse”</span> respectively. The former is in 16
        columns, after which come 5 columns which have been erased, probably,
        as Prof. Scheil remarks, to insert the name and titles of an Elamite
        king, Šutruk-Naḫḫunte, who has his inscription placed on several
        other monuments of Babylonian origin found there. For some reason or
        other, the space on the stele of Ḫammurabi still remains blank. The
        <span class="tei tei-q">“reverse”</span> has 28 columns of
        inscription. The columns are narrow, and the lines consequently
        short, but as the latter are no less than 3638 in number, the text is
        a very extensive one, and when complete, must have consisted of over
        4000 lines.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The inscription
        consists of three portions: the Introduction, consisting of 4 columns
        and 25 lines, detailing all the benefits which Ḫammurabi had
        conferred on the cities and temples of the land; the Laws, which
        occupy the remainder of the obverse, and 23 columns of the reverse
        (in all, 40 columns less 25 lines); and the Conclusion, occupying the
        remaining 5 columns, in which he recounts his own virtues, and in a
        long curse, calls upon the gods whom he worshipped to punish and
        destroy any of his successors who should abolish or change what he
        had written, or destroy his bas-relief.</p>

            </div>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">These laws, as
            being the oldest known, have attracted considerable attention,
            and much has been said concerning their connection with the
            Mosaic Code. Whatever connection there may be between them,
            however, it must be kept well in mind, that they have been
            formulated and compiled from totally different standpoints.
            Notwithstanding the references in the Code of Ḫammurabi to
            religious things, there is no doubt that the laws given therein
            are purely civil, and compiled either by the king as temporal
            ruler of the land, or by his advisers, or by the judges who
            <span class="tei tei-q">“decided the decisions of the
            land.”</span> Charitable enactments were therefore as far from
            the intention of the compilers of the Babylonian code as such
            things are from the intention of the legislation of this or any
            other modern civilized community or nationality. The Law of
            Moses, on the other hand, has long been recognized as a Priestly
            Code, into which all kinds of provisions for the poor, the
            fatherless, the necessitous, were likely to enter, and have, in
            fact, entered. From this point of view, Moses' code is
            immeasurably superior to that of the Babylonian law-giver, and
            can hardly, on that account, be compared with it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From existing
            duplicates of this inscription, we know that it bore a title
            which, in accordance with the usual custom in ancient times, was
            taken from the first few words of the <span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page520">[pg 520]</span><a name="Pg520" id="Pg520" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> inscription, in this case <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">Ninu îlu
            ṣîrum</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“When the supreme
            God.”</span> In the Ninevite duplicate in the British Museum,
            however, a kind of title in the modern sense of the word is
            given, namely, <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">Dinani Ḫammurabi</span></span>, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“The Laws of Ḫammurabi,”</span> the first word being
            from the common Semitic root which appears, in Semitic
            Babylonian, under the form of <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">dânu</span></span>, <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“to judge.”</span> As far as our information goes, it
            would seem that, whilst the Hebrew <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">tôrah</span></span> was both judicial,
            ceremonial, and moral, the Babylonian <span class=
            "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">dînu</span></span> was judicial only.
            Ceremonial enactments are entirely foreign to it, and morality,
            in the modern sense of the word, though represented, does not
            hold a very high place, though it must not be forgotten that five
            columns of the text are wanting.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">That there
            should be, therefore, but few parallels between the Codes of
            Moses and of Ḫammurabi was to be expected, though naturally
            likenesses and parallelisms are to be found, the Hebrews being
            practically of the same stock as the Babylonians, and also, as
            has been shown, under the influence of the same civilization. It
            will be noticed, in reading through the code, that not only are
            there no laws against sorcery, worshipping other than the
            national god or gods, and prostitution, but there are actually
            enactments referring to the first and the last, showing that they
            were recognized. Moral, religious, ceremonial, and philanthropic
            enactments are, in fact, entirely absent.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">3-4. With the
            enactments concerning false witness, cp. Ex. xx. 16; Deut. v. 20,
            etc. More especially, however, are the directions in Deut. xix.
            16 ff. noteworthy. Here the direction is, to do to the false
            witness <span class="tei tei-q">“as he had thought to do to his
            brother.”</span> In this case, too, the logical penalty would be
            death, in a matter involving the life of a man.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">7 (liability
            to be regarded as a thief on account of the purchase or receiving
            of things without witnesses or a contract) is to a certain extent
            paralleled by Lev. vi. 2 ff., where, however, the penalty for
            wrongful possession is not death, but the restoration of the
            object detained, with a fifth part of the value added
            thereto.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">8 (theft of
            live-stock) is illustrated by Ex. xxii. 1, where it is ordered
            that the thief restore five oxen for a stolen ox, and four sheep
            for a stolen sheep. All laws dealing with theft seem to have been
            more severe among the Babylonians than among the Hebrews, and
            inability to make the object good, with the penalties attached
            thereto, was visited with death (6-11, 14, 15, etc.).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">14. This
            enactment is exactly parallel with Ex. xxi. 16: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“He that stealeth a man ... shall surely be put to
            death.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page521">[pg

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">21
            (housebreaking). Ex. xxii. 2-4, justifies the killing of a
            burglar caught in the act before sunrise, but not otherwise.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">57. In the
            case of unlawful pasturing, it is probable that Ex. xxii. 5 may
            furnish the key to the obscurities of this Babylonian enactment.
            According to the Mosaic law, the owner of the cattle had to make
            the damage good with the best of his field or vineyard. To ensure
            getting the best, and his due share, the most satisfactory way
            would be to reap the offender's field, if he had one.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">110. The
            opening (seemingly in the English sense) of a wine-house by a
            temple-devotee, or her merely entering such a place, was in all
            probability equivalent to prostituting herself, and if so, this
            law may be compared with Lev. xxi. 9, in which the daughter of a
            priest, if she profaned herself (and her father) by playing the
            whore, was to be put to death by burning.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">117. As is
            shown by the preceding enactments, the person of a man might be
            seized for debt, but this shows that he might allow his wife, his
            son, or his daughter to be taken to work it off, and in that case
            they were to be set free in the fourth year. In Hebrew law (Ex.
            xxi. 2) an ordinary purchased slave was free after six years'
            service, but if a man sold his daughter (v. 7), she did not
            <span class="tei tei-q">“go out as the men-servants
            do.”</span><a id="noteref_295" name="noteref_295" href=

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">125. The theft
            of things on deposit entailed only restitution if the person with
            whom they were deposited were not in fault. In Ex. xxii. 7-9 the
            person condemned had to pay or restore double the value of the
            things stolen.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">129. In this
            law the conditional clause at the end is incomplete, but it may
            be supposed that liberty was accorded therein to the king and to
            the injured husband to exercise mercy, and commute the
            death-penalty in any way they thought fit, attaching thereto any
            other penalty which might seem good to them. According to Lev.
            xx. 10, the adulterer and the adulteress were to be put to death,
            but in what manner is not stated. To all appearance no mercy was
            given.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">130. As this
            is a case of a married woman living in her father's house, Ex.
            xxii. 16 is not an exact parallel. The woman being unbetrothed,
            the man who had violated her had to endow and marry her.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">155. Incest of
            the nature referred to here is practically a complete parallel
            with Lev. xx. 12, where, however, the nature of the death-penalty
            is not stated. If the correction of the code of Ḫammurabi
            suggested in the footnote (<span class="tei tei-q">“they shall
            bind that man, and cast <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">him</span></em> into the water”</span>) be
            the true one, the man <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page522">[pg
            522]</span><a name="Pg522" id="Pg522" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
            would seem to have been regarded as the chief sinner, and the
            woman was probably left to be dealt with by the son's family. The
            mere binding of the man, as in the text, would be no adequate
            punishment, and the correction: <span class="tei tei-q">“They
            shall bind <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
            "font-style: italic">them</span></em>, and cast <em class=
            "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></em>
            into the water,”</span> pre-supposes a very serious mistake on
            the part of the scribe.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">157. This is a
            parallel with Lev. xviii. 8, and xx. 11, and the penalty is death
            in both codes. The word <span class="tei tei-q">“mother”</span>
            in the Babylonian Code probably includes <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“step-mother”</span> as well.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">195. This is
            parallel with Ex. xxi. 15, where, however, the smiting of the
            mother is included, and the more severe penalty of death is
            prescribed, instead of merely cutting off the offending members
            as a punishment.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">196, 197, 200,
            210. These illustrate the dictum: <span class="tei tei-q">“An eye
            for an eye, and a tooth for tooth”</span> (Ex. xxi. 24, 25; Lev.
            xxiv. 20; Deut. xix. 21; Matt. v. 38). They were naturally the
            common punishments of the period when the penalty of imprisonment
            could not be imposed.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">199. The
            destruction of the eye of a man's slave, or the fracture of his
            limb, was apparently held to entail the diminution of his value
            by one-half, which the person who inflicted the injury had to
            pay. Nothing is said, however, concerning injury to a slave by
            his master, and this law, therefore, has no parallel in the
            Mosaic ordinance given in Ex. xxi. 26, 27, where the master is
            spoken of as the possible aggressor, and had to set his slave
            free on account of the injury he had received.<a id="noteref_296"
            name="noteref_296" href="#note_296"><span class=
            "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
            "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">206. The law
            regarding injuries inflicted upon a man in a quarrel is parallel
            with Ex. xxi. 18, 19, except that the latter decrees that the
            person inflicting the injury, in addition to causing the injured
            man to be completely healed, has also to pay for his loss of
            time. On the other hand, it is noteworthy that, in the Code of
            Ḫammurabi, he who committed the injury had to swear that he did
            not do it knowingly—that is, with the intention of injuring the
            man, otherwise he probably came under the law of retaliation,
            Nos. 196, 197, and 200.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">209. This is
            parallel with Ex. xxi. 22, but whereas the penalty for the injury
            to the woman was fixed at ten shekels of silver, the law of Moses
            allowed the husband to estimate the compensation, which was
            certified and probably revised by the judges.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">210. It was
            not only <span class="tei tei-q">“an eye for an eye, and a tooth
            for a tooth,”</span> but also <span class="tei tei-q">“a daughter
            for a daughter,”</span> even when a mortal injury may not have
            been intended. This is practically <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page523">[pg 523]</span><a name="Pg523" id="Pg523" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> the same as Ex. xxi. 23: <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give
            life for life.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">241. As this
            law stands, it refers to the unlawful working of another man's
            ox, and not to an ox taken in pledge, for the working of which
            there could be no remedy, any more than there was for taking a
            man's wife, child, or slave, in pledge to work out a debt.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">244 (loss of
            an animal through attack by a wild beast). Compare Ex. xxii. 13:
            <span class="tei tei-q">“If it (an animal delivered into the care
            of another) be torn in pieces, then let him bring it for witness,
            and he shall not make good that which was torn.”</span>
            Apparently there was no obligation to place the animal in a safe
            place. Cf. Gen. xxxi. 39 (Jacob's reproof to Laban): <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto
            thee; I bare the loss of it.”</span></p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">245 ff. These
            are to a certain extent illustrated by Ex. xxii. 14, 15, in which
            passage, if the owner of the injured animal was not present, the
            borrower had to make good any loss. If, however, the owner was
            there to protect it, there was no penalty, as he could in all
            probability have prevented the injury from being inflicted, and
            in any case might be supposed to have control over the
            animal.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">250. The owner
            of a furious bull was protected from loss, even though the result
            was fatal, if he did not know that the animal was vicious. In Ex.
            xxi. 28, though the owner of the offending ox was to go free, the
            animal itself was to be stoned to death, and its flesh not eaten.
            There is no doubt that this was hard on the owner, but it must
            have had an excellent effect, and ensured the proper enclosing of
            all doubtful animals.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">251. Even when
            the master knew that his ox was vicious, the Babylonians were
            more lenient than the Hebrews, who, in such a case, besides the
            destruction of the ox, decreed the death of the owner as a
            punishment for his negligence (Ex. xxi. 29). As will be seen from
            verse 30, however, he might be spared by paying such ransom as
            might be imposed upon him.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">252. One-third
            of a mana of silver is equivalent to 20 shekels, so that the sum
            here indicated as compensation for the death of a slave who has
            been gored by a bull differs from that awarded in Ex. xxi. 32, by
            ten shekels—one-sixth of a mana more.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">266. This is
            in part covered by 244 (destruction of cattle by a lion), and is
            parallel with Ex. xxii. 10, 11, where, also, an oath had to be
            sworn between the parties, and the herdsman in whose care the
            cattle were, went free of all obligation. The accident causing
            the loss, however, is not there described as <span class=
            "tei tei-q">“an act of God.”</span></p><span class="tei tei-pb"
            id="page524">[pg 524]</span><a name="Pg524" id="Pg524" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">267. The
            wording of this law clearly indicates that it would apply if the
            herdsman were in fault, and suggests that the same condition must
            be read into Ex. xxii. 12, where, if the cattle were stolen from
            him, he had to make the loss good.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Besides the
            enactments in the Code of Moses, however, we find, in the
            interesting and important monument translated above, and in the
            legal documents of the period to which it belongs, noteworthy
            parallels to other parts of the Old Testament. Reference has
            already been made (pp. <a href="#Pg174" class=
            "tei tei-ref">174</a>, <a href="#Pg175" class=
            "tei tei-ref">175</a>, and <a href="#Pg185" class=
            "tei tei-ref">185</a>, <a href="#Pg186" class=
            "tei tei-ref">186</a>) to the contracts of the period of
            Ḫammurabi's dynasty which illustrate the matter of Sarah giving
            Hagar to Abraham because she herself was childless (Gen. xvi. 1,
            2). That this was the custom in Babylonia is now confirmed by law
            144, which also furnishes the reason why it was the wife who
            chose her partner in the husband's affections. It was because the
            first wife preferred to choose herself the woman who was to
            replace her, and in doing this, she chose one who would be her
            subordinate, not one who might become a really serious rival. A
            parallel case is that of Bilhah (Gen. xxx. 4). Hagar's despising
            her mistress (Gen. xvi. 4) is illustrated by law No. 146, which
            allows the mistress to reduce her to the position of a slave
            again, which was agreed to by the patriarch, the result being
            that Hagar fled (v. 6).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
            determination to have the possession of the cave of Machpelah
            placed upon a thoroughly legal footing (Gen. xxiii. 14-20) may,
            perhaps, be illustrated by law No. 7, though there is not much
            parallelism between the two instances, a field with a cave and
            trees being a difficult thing to steal. There is hardly any
            doubt, however, that the patriarch desired that no accusation
            should be brought against him or his descendants for unlawfully
            using it, as is suggested by the fact that when Ephron offered to
            give it, he said that he did so <span class="tei tei-q">“in the
            presence of the sons of my people”</span> only, but when the
            transaction was completed as Abraham wished, it was done not only
            in the presence of the children of Heth, but before all who went
            in at the gate of his city (Gen. xxiii. 18), and naturally
            included strangers as well.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Abraham's
            seeking a wife for his son (Gen. xxiv. 4) is in conformity with
            laws 155, 156, and 166; gifts are given (Gen. xxiv. 53 and laws
            No. 159, 160, etc.); seemingly the father-in-law retained the
            presents given by his son-in-law, if he could get possession of
            them (Gen. xxxi. 15 and laws 159-161), and these belonged to the
            wife (wives) and the children (xxxi. 16 and laws 162, 167, 171,
            ff.).</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Whether the
            theft of her father's teraphim by Rachel (Gen. xxxi. 19) could be
            construed as sacrilege or not is doubtful, but this may well have
            been the penalty thought of by Jacob when Laban accused some of
            his household of theft (Gen. xxxi. <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
            "page525">[pg 525]</span><a name="Pg525" id="Pg525" class=
            "tei tei-anchor"></a> 32 and law No. 6), though theft, if there
            were no restitution, was in Babylonian law always punishable with
            death.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The punishment
            of death by burning, which Judah decreed for his daughter-in-law
            Tamar (Gen. xxxviii. 24), is parallel with that meted out to a
            devotee opening or entering a wine-house (probably a place of
            ill-repute), but the parallel ends there—there is no law in the
            code of Ḫammurabi, as at present preserved, decreeing death by
            burning for a widow who became a harlot.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Theft from a
            palace (law No. 6) is parallel with Gen. xliv. 9, where the sons
            of Jacob admit the justice of a death-penalty if Joseph's cup
            were found in the possession of any of them. Whether the purchase
            of the Egyptians and their land for bread by Joseph had any
            analogy in Western Asia or not, is uncertain, though law No. 115,
            as well as those which precede it, refer to something similar,
            but in these cases the servitude was terminable, which does not
            appear from Gen. xlvii. 19 ff. Thereafter the Egyptian ruler took
            from these farmer-thralls a fifth part of the produce, which
            compares well with the half or third exacted by the owner of a
            field in Babylonia from the hirer (law 46). Finally, the clauses
            of the laws of Ḫammurabi referring to adoption (No. 185) might be
            quoted in illustration of the adoption of Ephraim and Manasseh by
            their grandfather Jacob (Gen. xlviii. 5), especially when read in
            connection with the inscriptions translated on pp. <a href=
            "#Pg176" class="tei tei-ref">176</a> and <a href="#Pg177" class=
            "tei tei-ref">177</a>, where the sharing of the adopted son
            <span class="tei tei-q">“like a son”</span> is expressly referred
            to.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the New
            Testament, Gal. iv. 30: <span class="tei tei-q">“Cast out the
            bondwoman and her son, for the son of the bondwoman shall not be
            heir with the son of the freewoman,”</span> finds illustration in
            law 171 of Ḫammurabi's code, and the parable of the talents
            (Matt. xxv. 14 ff.) reminds one of the agent sending forth
            commissioners to get gain for him by trafficking, as in laws
            100-102. 103-107 do not bear directly upon this parallel, but are
            worth noting in connection with it.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It will be
            long ere all that can be said about this noteworthy inscription
            finds expression. There is much needing comment, and much to
            study therein, and the precise rendering of many a word has still
            to be found out.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">A great deal
            has been written concerning the two lectures which the renowned
            Assyriologist, Friedrich Delitzsch, delivered some time ago
            before the German Emperor, under the title of <span class=
            "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Babel und

            "Pg526" id="Pg526" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> and from their
            style and contents, one can easily judge how great was the
            interest which they aroused. Those who were privileged to hear
            them must have enjoyed a true archæological feast, all the more
            exquisite in that the subject was that which throws more light
            upon the Old Testament than any other known.</p>

            <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">His lectures
            deal, for the most part, with the things which are touched upon
            at greater length in this book—the early records of Babylonia and
            Assyria, the history, the literature, the arts, and the sciences
            of those countries, and of the great cities of which they were so
            proud. Beginning with <span class="tei tei-q">“the great

            has been treated of in this book, and that being the case, all

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">From the
              above it will be seen, that the <span class=
              "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">šapattum</span></span> or Sabbath was the
              15th day of the month, and that only. That it was a day of
              rest, is shown by the etymology, the word being derived from
              the Sumerian <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">ša-bat</span></span>, <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“heart-rest,”</span> which probably has, therefore,
              no connection with the Semitic root <span class=
              "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">šabātu</span></span>, which, as far as at
              present known, is a synonym of <span class=
              "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">gamāru</span></span>, <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“to complete.”</span> It was the day of rest of the
              heart, but being the 15th, it was also the day when the moon
              reached the full in the heart or middle of the month, and its
              name may, therefore, contain a <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
              "page528">[pg 528]</span><a name="Pg528" id="Pg528" class=
              "tei tei-anchor"></a> play upon the two ideas which the word
              <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">libbu</span></span> contains. In
              accordance with the general rule, the consonants of words
              borrowed from the Sumerian were often sharpened when
              transferred to Semitic Babylonian, hence the form <span class=
              "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">šapattum</span></span> instead of
              <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">šabattum</span></span>, though the latter
              is also found.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The nearest
              approach to the Sabbath, in the Jewish sense, among the
              Babylonians, is the <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">û-ḫulgala</span></span> or <span class=
              "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">ûmu
              limnu</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the evil
              day,”</span> which, as we know from the Hemerologies, was the
              7th, 14th, 21st, 28th, and 19th day of each month, the last so
              called because it was a week of weeks from the 1st day of the
              foregoing month. It is this, therefore, which contains the germ
              of the idea of the Jewish Sabbath, but it was not that Sabbath
              in the true sense of the term, for if the months had 30 days,
              the week following the 28th had 9 days instead of 7, and weeks
              of 8 and 9 days therefore probably occurred twelve times each
              year. The nature of this original of the Sabbath is shown by
              the Hemerologies, which describe how it was to be kept in the
              following words:—</p>

              already been stated (p. <a href="#Pg112" class=

              Delitzsch, answering the criticisms of Oettli, agrees. Replying
              to König, he energetically repudiates the idea that
              <span class="tei tei-q">“the Babylonian hero saves his dead and
              living property, but in both Biblical accounts there appears,
              instead of that, the higher point of view of the preservation
              of the animal-world.”</span> He then cites Berosus, according
              to whom Xisuthros received the command to take into the ark
              winged and four-footed animals, and quotes the line translated
              on p. <a href="#Pg103" class="tei tei-ref">103</a>:
              <span class="tei tei-q">“I caused to go up into the midst of

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Prof.
                Delitzsch's notes upon the Dragon of Chaos are exceedingly
                interesting, as is also the picture which he gives, from a
                little seal in the form of a long bead, of the god Merodach
                <span class="tei tei-q">“clothed in his majestic glory, with
                powerful arm, and broad eye and ear, the symbols of his
                intelligence, and at the feet of the god the captive Dragon
                of the primæval waters.”</span> From our point of view the
                deity does not look very majestic, but it is an exceedingly
                interesting representation, the more especially as he bears
                in his left hand (in the drawing) the circle and staff of
                Šamaš, the sun, showing the correctness of the theory which
                made Merodach likewise a sun-god. It is noteworthy, however,
                that a similar object found by the German expedition to
                Babylonia shows a figure of Hadad, the wind-god, as the
                Babylonians conceived him, and accompanying him are a winged
                dragon and another creature—indeed, each deity seems to have
                had his own special attendant of this nature. Are we,
                therefore, to understand that each deity overcame a dragon or
                other animal? or may it not be, that Merodach had a kind of
                dragon as his attendant, and the one depicted sitting by his
                side, close to his feet, is the creature devoted to him, and
                not the Dragon of Chaos at all?</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Dragon
                of Chaos, Tiamtu or Tiawthu, appears in the inscriptions as
                the representative of the Hebrew <span class=

                "Pg530" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> is the same word without
                the feminine ending. It is also regarded, however, as being
                represented in the Old Testament by <span lang="he" class=

                explained as <span class="tei tei-q">“the winding
                one,”</span> <span class="tei tei-q">“the dragon,”</span> and
                <span class="tei tei-q">“the monster”</span> respectively. As
                far as our knowledge at present goes, none of these names
                occur in the Babylonian inscriptions, but there is sufficient
                analogy between the Biblical passages which contain them and
                the story of Tiamtu to establish an identity between the two
                sources.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
                passage <span class="tei tei-q">“Awake, awake,”</span> etc.
                (Is. li. 9), the cutting of Rahab in pieces, and the piercing
                of the dragon, are made into similes typifying the drying up
                of the Red Sea, so that the Israelites might pass over, and
                on this account the words standing for these creatures seem
                to have become an allegorical way of referring to Egypt,
                caught, like Tiamtu, in a net (Ezek. xxxii. 2, 3). In Job ix.
                13 the <span class="tei tei-q">“helpers of Rahab”</span> are
                mentioned, recalling the gods who aided Tiamtu, and in xxvi.
                12 <span class="tei tei-q">“he smiteth through Rahab”</span>
                is a reminiscence of the piercing of the head of Merodach's
                opponent.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In Job
                xli. 3 the words <span class="tei tei-q">“Lay thine hand upon
                him; remember <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
                "font-style: italic">the battle</span></em>, and do so no
                more,”</span> evidently refer to leviathan in v. 1, here
                typical of Tiamtu, the battle being that which Merodach
                fought with her. <span class="tei tei-q">“Shall not one be
                cast down even at the sight of him?”</span> in verse 9,
                recalls the dreadful appearance of Tiamtu and her helpers,
                whose aspect filled the gods of the Babylonians with fear.
                Still another parallel is to be found in the verse
                <span class="tei tei-q">“Their (the enemies') wine is the
                poison of dragons (<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign"
                xml:lang="he"><span style=
                "font-style: italic">tanninim</span></span>),”</span> Deut.
                xxxii. 33, reminding us of the monsters created by Tiamtu,
                whose bodies were filled with poison like blood.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">All these
                passages naturally prove that the legend was well known to
                the Hebrews, and must also have been current among their
                neighbours. Though they identified her with the sea
                (<span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
                "he"><span style="font-style: italic">tehom</span></span>),
                they did not, to all appearance, use that word to indicate
                the Dragon of Chaos, as did the Babylonians—she was a
                serpent, a dragon, or a monster. Though she may be the type
                of the serpent-tempter (the difference of sex makes a little
                difficulty), the compiler of the first two chapters of
                Genesis rigorously excluded her from the Hebrew
                Creation-story. The story of leviathan, the dragon, or the
                monster, was a legend current among the people, and used by
                the Hebrew sacred writers as a useful simile, but it seems to
                have formed no part of orthodox Hebrew religious belief.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Prof.
                Delitzsch has boldly reproduced, on p. 36 of his <span class=
                "tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Babel und
                Bibel</span></span> (German edition), what has been regarded
                in England as the driving of the evil spirit from the temple
                built at Calah by Aššur-naṣir-âpli (885 <span class=
                "tei tei-hi"><span style=
                "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>), but he calls
                it <span class="tei tei-q">“Fight with the <span class=
                "tei tei-pb" id="page531">[pg 531]</span><a name="Pg531" id=
                "Pg531" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> Dragon.”</span> The evil
                spirit represented is certainly a kind of dragon, but on the
                original slab in the British Museum the creature is a male,
                and not a female, as in the Babylonian Creation-story.
                Identification with the Dragon of Chaos is therefore in the
                highest degree improbable, and as it would seem from his
                answer to Jensen, Delitzsch does not regard it as having
                anything to do with the Creation-story, but a representation
                of <span class="tei tei-q">“a fight between the power of
                light and the power of darkness in general.”</span> This
                seems exceedingly probable, as is also his statement that in
                such a conception as that of Tiamtu, it may easily be
                imagined that plenty of room for fancy existed.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
                serpent-tempter in Gen. iii. 1 is an ordinary serpent,
                <span lang="he" class="tei tei-foreign" xml:lang=
                "he"><span style="font-style: italic">naḫas</span></span>,
                the type of the evil one. He had no part in the creation, and
                was to all appearance one of the beasts of the field created
                by God. Tiamtu, his Babylonian parallel, on the other hand,
                does not seem to have been in any sense a tempter—she simply
                tried to overcome the gods of heaven, aided by her followers
                and offspring, among whom were some of the divine beings
                created by the gods. That in consequence of this, she may
                have been regarded as having tempted those of her followers
                who were the offspring of the gods of heaven, is not only
                possible, but probable, and if provable, we should have here
                the identification of the Dragon of Chaos with the
                serpent-tempter.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">And this
                leads him to the question as to whether the celebrated
                cylinder-seal referred to on p. <a href="#Pg079" class=
                "tei tei-ref">79</a> is really intended to be a picture of
                the circumstance of the fall of man. Delitzsch points out,
                that the clothed condition of the figures prevents him from
                recognizing in the tree the tree <span class="tei tei-q">“of
                knowledge of good and evil”</span>—perhaps there glimmers
                through the Biblical account in Gen. ii. and iii. another and
                older form of the story, in which only one tree, the tree of
                life, appeared. The words in ii. 9: <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“and the tree of the knowledge of good and
                evil,”</span> seem, as it were, patched on, and the narrator
                completely forgets this newly-introduced <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“tree of the knowledge of good and evil”</span>
                to the extent, that he even, by oversight, makes God allow
                man, in contradiction to iii. 22, to eat of the Tree of Life
                (ii. 16). All this seems very plausible, but may it not be,
                that man, before eating of the tree of knowledge, was
                permitted to eat of the tree of life, which was denied to him
                after the Fall? If this be the case, there was probably no
                forgetfulness on the part of the narrator, and the story
                hangs excellently together. And here it is to be noted that
                both the tree of life, and the tree of the knowledge of good
                and evil, were in the midst of the garden (ii. 9), that the
                woman seems to be aware of the existence of one tree only
                (iii. 3), and there is no statement that the man knew the
                nature of the fruit which his wife handed to him (6), though
                <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page532">[pg 532]</span><a name=
                "Pg532" id="Pg532" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> it may be
                surmised that, with the prohibition with regard to one of
                them in his mind, he ought to have inquired. The heaviest
                punishment therefore falls upon the tempter, the woman coming
                next, and the man having the lightest though even his is
                sufficiently severe.</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">In the
                design on the cylinder Delitzsch sees a male and a female
                figure, with a serpent, and in this both Hommel and Jensen
                agree. Delitzsch, moreover, says: <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“The distinguishing of the one figure by horns,
                which was, in Babylonia, as in Israel, equally the common
                symbol of strength and victoriousness, I regard as a very
                delicate device of the artist to introduce into the two
                clothed human figures the sex-distinction in an unmistakable
                manner.”</span> He is of opinion that nothing very decisive
                can as yet be pronounced concerning the serpent, but one
                might connect therewith the appearance of Tiamtu, who also,
                like leviathan in Job iii. 8 and <span class="tei tei-q">“the
                old serpent”</span> in the Apocalypse, may be assumed to have
                been still existing. (Compare p. <a href="#Pg032" class=
                "tei tei-ref">32</a> of the present work, lines 112 and
                113.)</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">He points
                out that in a list of rivers, etc., there is one called

                is also a confirmation of the theory that the Babylonians
                possessed the legend of the serpent-tempter. Noteworthy also

                The Cherubim.</h5>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Concerning
                the Cherubs something has been said in this book, pp. 80-82,
                and to this Prof. Delitzsch adds a few more instances. As
                others have done, he regards the cherubim of the Babylonians
                and Assyrians as being the winged bulls, with heads of men.
                As an angel he gives a picture of a winged female figure
                holding a necklace<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305"
                href="#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style=
                "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a>;
                the demons he depicts are from the slabs in the Assyrian
                Saloon of the British Museum, where two of these beings are
                fighting with each other; and devils he regards as being
                typified by a small but mutilated statuette of a creature
                with an animal's head, long erect ears, and open mouth with
                threatening teeth. For the existence of guardian-angels he
                quotes the letter of Ablâ to the queen-mother: <span class=
                "tei tei-q">“Bel and Nebo's messenger of grace (<span class=

                ša dunqi ša Bêl u Nabû</span></span>) will go with the king
                of the countries, my lord.”</span> Of especial interest,
                however, is his reference to the inscription of Nabopolassar,
                in which that founder of the latest of the Babylonian empires
                states that Merodach <span class="tei tei-q">“called him to
                rule over the land and the people, caused a guardian-god
                (cherub) to go by his side, and caused all the work which he
                undertook to succeed.”</span> Besides the cherubs or
                guardian-angels, the Babylonians believed in numerous evil
                gods and devils, besides Tiamtu and the serpent-tempter of
                mankind.</p>

                Babylonian Monotheism.</h5>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
                question of Babylonian monotheism, and of the antiquity of
                the name Yahweh (Jehovah) attracted a considerable amount of
                attention, and has been supplemented by Delitzsch very fully
                in the notes to his first lecture. Upon this point something
                was said in the present volume (pp. <a href="#Pg047" class=
                "tei tei-ref">47</a> and <a href="#Pg058" class=
                "tei tei-ref">58-61</a>), and the author is practically at
                one with Prof. Delitzsch. As the inscription translated on p.
                <a href="#Pg058" class="tei tei-ref">58</a> shows, the
                Babylonians were monotheists, and yet they were not. They
                believed in all their various gods, and at the same time
                identified those gods with Merodach. Just as, in the beliefs
                of India, each soul may be regarded as emanating from, and
                returning to, the Creator, and forming one with Him at the
                final death of the body, so the gods of the Babylonians were
                apparently regarded as parts of, and emanations from,
                Merodach, the chief of the gods, who, <span class=
                "tei tei-pb" id="page534">[pg 534]</span><a name="Pg534" id=
                "Pg534" class="tei tei-anchor"></a> when they conferred upon
                him their names, conferred upon him in like manner their
                being. It is in this way alone that Merodach, the last-born
                of the great gods, can be regarded as the father and begetter
                of the gods (see pp. <a href="#Pg045" class=
                "tei tei-ref">45</a>, <a href="#Pg046" class=
                "tei tei-ref">46</a>).</p>

                <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Prof.
                Delitzsch has therefore done a service in bringing more
                prominently to the notice of students and scholars the text
                of which the obverse is printed on p. <a href="#Pg058" class=
                "tei tei-ref">58</a>, and mentioning the paper where it first
                appeared.<a id="noteref_306" name="noteref_306" href=

                The study of the religion of the Babylonians and Assyrians
                has been greatly furthered thereby.</p>

                present author, many names supporting this idea. Thus he

                (Baruḫi-ilu, probably a Jew, and Idiḫi-îlu). It will
                therefore be seen that names of a monotheistic nature were
                common in Babylonia at all periods, but as they are greatly
                outnumbered by the polytheistic ones,<a id="noteref_310"

                their exact value as testimony to monotheism, or to a

              important of all, however, from the point of view of the
              history of the religion of the Jews, is what Delitzsch states
              concerning the name Jahweh (Jehovah). On p. 46 of his first
              lecture (German edition) he gives half-tone reproductions of
              three tablets preserved in the British Museum, which, according
              to him, contain three forms of the personal name meaning
              <span class="tei tei-q">“Jahwe is God”</span>—<span class=
              "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">Ya'we-îlu</span></span>, <span class=

              "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">Yaum-îlu</span></span>. The last of these
              names we may dismiss at once, the form being clearly not that
              of Yahweh, but of Yah, the Jah of Ps. civ. 35 and several other
              passages. The other two, however, are not so lightly dealt
              with, notwithstanding the objections of other Assyriologists
              and Orientalists. It is true that Ya'pi-îlu and Yapi-îlu are
              possible readings, but Delitzsch's objections to them are
              soundly based, and can hardly be set aside. The principal
              argument against the identification of Ya'we or Yawe with
              Yahwah is, that we should have here, about 2000 years before
              Christ, a form of the word which is really later than that used
              by the Jewish captives at Babylon 500 years before Christ, when
              it was to all appearance pronounced Ya(')awa or Yâwa (see pp.
              458, 465, 470, 471). If, however, we may read the name Ya'wa
              (Ya'awa) or Yâwa, as is possible, then there is nothing against
              the identification proposed by Delitzsch. That [Cuneiform] was
              used with the value of <span class=
              "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">wa</span></span> is proved by such words
              as <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">warka</span></span>, <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“after,”</span> where the reading <span class=
              "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">wearka</span></span> seems to be
              impossible, and the necessary distinction between <span class=
              "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">ma</span></span> and <span class=
              "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">wa</span></span> (the former was written
              with a different character) would be maintained. It is worthy
              of note that Ya'wa must have been more of a name than Yau,
              which was a primitive Babylonian word for <span class=
              "tei tei-q">“God,”</span> it is doubtful whether it could
              always be written without the divine prefix. As, however, the
              divine name Ae or Ea, with others, is often written so
              unprovided, such an objection as this could not be held to
              invalidate Delitzsch's contention.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              probability therefore is, that Delitzsch is right in
              transcribing <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page536">[pg
              536]</span><a name="Pg536" id="Pg536" class=
              "tei tei-anchor"></a> the name as he has done, if we may change
              the final <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">e</span></em> to <em class=
              "tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></em>,
              and he is also probably right in his identification.
              Nevertheless, we require more information from the records of
              ancient Babylonia before we can say, with certainty, that the
              first component of the name Ya'wa-îlu is the Yahweh of the
              Hebrews, though we are bound to admit that the identification
              is in the highest degree probable. Delitzsch speaks of the
              possibility of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
              "font-style: italic">ya've</span></span> being a verbal form
              (it would be parallel to names like Yabnik-îlu), only to reject
              it, as a name meaning <span class="tei tei-q">“God
              exists”</span> (Hommel and Zimmern) is certainly not what one
              would expect to find. On the other hand, Zimmern admits the
              possibility that Yaum may be the name of a god, and possibly
              the name Yahu, Yahve may be present in it. As he is against
              Delitzsch on the whole, this is an important admission.</p>

          excavations at Boghaz-Köi began where fragments of tablets had
          already been found, namely, on the slope of the hill at Böyük-kale,
          the documents becoming more complete as the explorers went higher.
          Another mass of records was found at the foot of the hill, by the
          ruins of the temple. It was in the upper find that the Babylonian
          version of the treaty between Rameses II. and the Hittite king
          Ḫattušil was found. The founder of the dynasty was Šubbiluliuma,
          the name read <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Sapalulu</span></span> in the Egyptian version
          of the treaty. He was evidently a warrior-king, whose overlordship
          the state of Mitanni acknowledged, and seems to have been succeeded
          by his son Arandaš. The next ruler was Muršil, the <span class=

          "font-style: italic">Khetasir</span></span> of Egyptologists)
          mounted the throne. His queen was Pudu-ḫipa, and they had a son
          Dudḫalia, whose name recalls the Tidal (Tid'al) of the 14th chapter
          of Genesis, and the Tudḫula (or Tudḫul) of the tablets which

          Winckler, the explorer of Boghaz-Köi, who has published many
          interesting details of the result of his researches, states that

          Ḫabiri, and that not only the Sa-gas people, but also the Sa-gas
          gods are referred to. For these latter, he says, compare the image

          evidently one of the documents obtained by Mr. Hormuzd Rassam at
          Sippar (Abu-habbah), as the reference to Bunene, one of the deities

          being only eight lines (five of them incomplete) on the obverse,
          and the remains of the last three lines of the communication on the
          reverse. What makes it probable that the Belshazzar who sent the
          letter is the son of Nabonidus, and the hero of the fall of
          Babylon, is, that no honorific expressions are used with reference
          to the person to whom it is addressed—he does not call
          Mušêzib-Marduk his lord, or father, or brother, as was the custom

          are in a ruinous state, partly due to the ravages of time, but
          principally to the Fellahin, who have for many years dug there for

          said to have been found, Greek papyri were discovered, but
          proceeding north of that point, the German explorers soon came upon
          the Aramaic fragments. Those first found are said to have been in
          earthen vessels, but the most important of them (the texts
          translated below) were buried, without any protective covering,
          close to the eastern and southern walls of the room in which they
          lay. To all appearance these last had escaped the notice of the
          earlier excavators, who had thrown them away with the rubbish cast

          Yoḫanan mentioned on p. <a href="#Pg539" class=

          because the latter, supported by Bagoas, sought to dispute with him
          the High-priesthood. Notwithstanding the protests of the Jews,
          Bagoas penetrated into the temple, and imposed upon it a fine of 50
          drachmas for every lamb sacrificed therein. It will thus be seen,
          that in offering to him a percentage of the sacrifices in return
          for his support in rebuilding the temple at Yeb, Yedoniah and his
          companions were acting in accordance with what was known to be his
          character. The reference to Yohanan's refraining from helping them,
          it is reasonable to suppose, also occurred to them as likely to
          further their desires.</p>

          have been identified with a third of the name, Yedoniah ben Nathan,

          Elephantine profited by his absence to destroy the Jewish temple
          there. In this they were supported by Waidrang, who, in the absence
          of Arsames, seems to have exercised the office of governor. To all
          appearance he had been commander-in-chief of the army in Egypt, a
          post held, at the time this document was written, by Nephyan his
          son. There is some doubt as to the reading and vocalization of the
          name Waidrang, and consequently, also, as to its true form, but it
          is regarded as certainly Persian. It is thought that its Persian
          prototype may have been <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Vayu-darengha</span></span>,<a id=
          "noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href="#note_331"><span class=
          "tei tei-noteref"><span style=
          "font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a>
          <span class="tei tei-q">“companion of the wind-god,”</span> whilst
          his son's name, in Persian, is possibly <span class=
          "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
          "font-style: italic">Napâo-yâna</span></span>, <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“favour of the god Napâo.”</span> Should these
          identifications be found correct, they will have, as Sachau
          remarks, considerable value in ascertaining the principle upon
          which names in Persian were given.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">To all
          appearance Arsames returned to Egypt, and a reaction followed which
          ended in the disgrace of Waidrang and his followers, who were
          deprived of the spoils which they had stolen from the temple at
          Yeb, and the Jews also became, in <span class="tei tei-pb" id=
          "page543">[pg 543]</span><a name="Pg543" id="Pg543" class=
          "tei tei-anchor"></a> the end, witnesses of the death of all their
          persecutors. It seems probable that the central government was
          greatly displeased at the action of Waidrang and the priests of
          Chnub, for the Persians seem always to have been well-disposed
          towards the Jews—moreover, cupidity, and not the good of the state,
          was at the bottom of Waidrang's action. The destruction wrought,
          however, was not immediately made good, hence this document, which
          throws such a vivid light upon the state of Egypt and the Jews in
          those days. It is but just to the Persians of that period to say,
          that notwithstanding their seemingly Persian names, Waidrang and
          his son were apparently not Persians, but possibly Semites, as the
          (probably gentilic) adjectives applied to the former seem to
          show.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The date of this
          document is regarded as not admitting of any doubt, as may be
          gathered by the references to the regnal years of Darius in
          conjunction with the names of historical personages—Bagohi (Bagoas
          or Bagoses of Josephus), governor of Judea, Yehoḥanan or John, the
          high-priest at Jerusalem, and the two sons of Sanaballaṭ,<a id=

          governor of Samaria in the time of Artaxerxes I. (Longimanus). The
          ruler of the Persian empire when these documents were written, must
          therefore have been Darius II. (Nothus), who reigned for 19 years,
          namely, 424-405 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> The 14th year of
          Darius II.—the date of the destruction of the temple at Yeb—was 410
          <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span>, and his 17th
          year—the date when the appeal was sent to Bagohi—corresponds with
          407 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style=
          "font-variant: small-caps">b.c.</span></span> This fixes, among
          others, the date of Yehoḥanan, and Sachau points out as noteworthy
          that one of his brothers, named Manasseh, was son-in-law of the
          governor of Samaria, Sanaballaṭ, as related in Nehemiah xiii. 28.
          Another brother of the high-priest was the one whom he killed in
          the temple (Jesus). In this record, however, a third brother, Ostan
          or Ostanes, appears. To all appearance this last bore also another
          name, to wit, 'Ahani, which would be his true Hebrew appellation.
          If, however, the Babylonian construction has been followed here,
          this Ostan or Ostanes would be brother of 'Ahani, a personage of
          importance in Jerusalem, but not otherwise known. Adopting the
          rendering given in the translation, however, it is noteworthy that
          two brothers named Yehoḥanan and 'Ahani are mentioned in 1
          Chronicles iii. 24. These, however, were descendants of David,
          whereas the brothers mentioned in the papyrus must have been
          descendants of Aaron.</p>

          tablets in the British Museum, and also on one in the possession of
          Lord Amherst of Hackney. He bears the title <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“governor of Babylon and across the river,”</span>
          possibly meaning all the tract west of the Euphrates. This man,
          however, can hardly at the same time have been governor of Egypt,
          and the texts in which he is mentioned seem, moreover, to belong to
          the time of Darius Hystaspis, in which case he lived at a much too
          early date.</p>

          <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The Egyptians
          called the island of Elephantine Yeb, and its capital bore the same
          name as the island. It is transcribed Ab by those who follow the
          old system of reading Egyptian, so that the present documents seem
          to support the philological views of the Berlin school. A common
          ideograph for the name of the island is an elephant with an
          upturned trunk, showing that Yeb really means <span class=
          "tei tei-q">“elephant-island,”</span> and that Elephantine is
          simply the Greek translation of the native name. The temple of
          Khnum (Khnumba, Khnub), whose priests are referred to in the
          papyri, was destroyed by Moḥammed Ali in 1822.</p>

          have been pronounced <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=

          papyri found at Elephantine on account of chronological
          difficulties. In the case of the documents here translated,
          however, no such difficulties can be said to exist, and the forger
          of such things would have to be not only a splendid Aramaic scholar
          acquainted with the Berlin scheme of transcribing Egyptian, but
          also a historian and the possessor of an exceedingly lively
          imagination.</p>

          included some papyri still in roll-form, and various fragments. The
          principal document translated above belonged to the former
          category, and was successfully unrolled by Herr Ibscher, the keeper
          of the Royal Museum. The reproduction shows it as a large sheet of
          papyrus, folded in two, and certain damaged portions, on the left,
          imply that it was rolled upon itself about six times.</p>

        Archæology</span></span> for March and May, 1903, where a comparison
        of the two versions is also given. It speaks of his visit to the land
        of darkness in quest of his friend Ea-banî (whose name, as this
        inscription indicates, should properly be read Enki-du or Ea(Aê,
        Aa)-du). In the second column it details his conversation with Siduri
        (<span class="tei tei-q">“the <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Sabitu</span></span>”</span>), in which he
        refers to the death of his beloved companion, since whose departure
        he had not sought to live, but having seen her face, he expresses the
        hope that he will now not see death. The <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Sabitu</span></span>, however, answers him to
        the effect that he would not find the life which he sought—death was
        the lot which the gods had set for mankind. Eat, therefore, make
        festival, rejoice day and night, put on fine apparel, take pleasure
        in child and wife—such was her advice. In the last <span class=
        "tei tei-pb" id="page548">[pg 548]</span><a name="Pg548" id="Pg548"
        class="tei tei-anchor"></a> column of this version the hero meets
        with Sur-Sunabu (Ur-Šanabi), who asks him his name. Gilgameš tells
        him who he is and whence he came, and asks to be shown Uta-naištim,
        the remote, as the Babylonian Noah seems to be called in this version
        of the legend. About one-third of the tablet, giving the lower parts
        of columns 1 and 2, and the upper parts of columns 3 and 4, is the
        amount preserved.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The above seems to
        show, that the name of the friend of Gilgameš was Êa-du, (Aa-du,
        Aê-du, or Enki-du), not Êa-banî; whilst Ur-Šanabi the boatman, was
        really called Sur-Sunabu (or Sur-Šanabi); and Pir-napištim, the
        Babylonian Noah, was Ut-napištim.</p>

        correct, the throwing down of a part of the food recalls the casting
        of meal on the ground as an offering to the gods. It is not unlikely
        that the preparation of the food, and setting it by his head, was
        accompanied by some prayer or incantation to secure his recovery, as
        in the inscription translated in the <span class=

        special meaning. On p. <a href="#Pg111" class="tei tei-ref">111</a>,
        there is just the possibility that <span class="tei tei-q">“The

        for the gods, and <span class="tei tei-q">“the rejected of the

        with Nebo. The centres where these gods were worshipped therefore had
        likewise their monotheistic system, in which all the other gods were
        identified with the patron-deity of the place, just as those
        Babylonians who worshipped Merodach identified all the other gods
        with him.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">P. <a href=
        "#Pg119" class="tei tei-ref">119</a>. There has been a great deal of
        discussion as to the way in which Šumer could be connected with
        Shinar, the chief <span class="tei tei-pb" id="page549">[pg
        549]</span><a name="Pg549" id="Pg549" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
        reasons against their identification being that the latter must have
        come from a Babylonian form, of whose existence there is no evidence,
        and that it stood for the whole country (except, possibly, Larsa),
        whereas Šumer was the name of the southern part only. Hommel derives
        the Biblical Shinar from Ki-Imgir, through the intermediate forms
        Shingar, Shumir (Šumer) and Shimir. This is based upon the tendency
        which <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">k</span></span> had to change into <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">š</span></span>,
        whilst the substitution of <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">m</span></span> for an older <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span> or
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">ng</span></span> can be proved. As, however,
        Shinar corresponds practically with the whole of Babylonia, a
        modification of Prof. Hommel's etymology may, perhaps, best meet the
        case. The whole of the country was called by the Sumerians Kingi (or
        Kengi) Ura, and the expression <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mâda
        Kingi-Ura</span></span> is rendered, in the lists, <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">mât Šumeri u
        Akkadī</span></span>, <span class="tei tei-q">“the land of Sumer and
        Akkad.”</span> It is therefore clear, that Kingi-Ura corresponds with
        the whole tract, and is practically synonymous with the Biblical
        Shinar. The change from <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">k</span></span> to <span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style="font-style: italic">š
        (sh)</span></span> being provable, it is possible that Kingi-Ura,
        pronounced Shingi-Ura, may have originated the Hebrew form Shinar
        (better Shin'ar), through the intermediate forms Shingura and
        Shingar.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The statement that
        Elam was the firstborn of Shem (Gen. x. 22) receives illustration
        from the fact, that many inscriptions have been found showing that
        Semitic Babylonian was not only well known, but also used in that
        country. From the order in which the names occur in Genesis, it ought
        to be the earliest of the Semitic settlements, coming before Asshur,
        Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram. If, however, Arpachshad stand, as is
        generally thought, for Babylonia, it is quite clear that there is no
        indication of chronological order in this, for Assyria was certainly
        younger, as a Semitic settlement, than Babylonia, and it would seem
        that Elam was colonized with Semites from the last-named country.
        This would make Elam to be simply the first Semitic colony, as Prof.
        Scheil has already suggested.</p>

        the Sumerians had become one nation with the Semitic Babylonians, the
        type of the figures represented on the cylinder-seals and sculptures
        remained unchanged, and it is on this account that Ḫammurabi is
        portrayed, on the slab reproduced as pl. <a href="#Plate_I" class=

        In pl. <a href="#Plate_VI" class="tei tei-ref">VI.</a> the Sumerian
        style is there, but the type is rather thick. This, however, may be
        partly due to the sliding of the cylinder when the impression was

        Another suggestion is, that Nimrod may be the name of Merodach, as
        <span class="tei tei-q">“Lord of Marad”</span> (Nin-Marad). As far as
        I have been able to see, however, this name of Merodach does not
        occur, and moreover, it was Nergal, and not Merodach, who was lord of
        Marad—Merodach's city was Babylon. Prof. Hommel's acute suggestion,
        that Namra-ṣit may be a Babylonian form of Nimrod, would seem to be
        doubtful.</p>

        Merodach, after his fight with Tiamtu, was placed in the heavens, and
        seemingly became one of the constellations, but we do not hear of any
        similar honour having been conferred on his net, notwithstanding the
        great service which it had rendered him. In Habakkuk i. 15-17 there
        is a curious passage in which <span class="tei tei-q">“the
        Chaldean”</span> is described as catching men with his angle and his
        net, as fishes are caught, and making sacrifice to his net and his
        drag on account of his success with them. Heuzey, the well-known
        French Assyriologist and antiquarian, makes a comparison between this
        passage and the Vulture-stele, on which an ancient Babylonian prince
        is represented as having placed his conquered foes in a great net.
        This, however, does not explain the statement that the Chaldean
        sacrificed and offered incense to his net and his drag, and it is
        doubtful whether the Prophet had either that or any similar sculpture
        or picture in his mind. There is, nevertheless, just the possibility
        that the Babylonians were accustomed to pay divine honours to the net
        of Merodach, and this may have given rise to the statement in the
        passage quoted. Whether the relief on the Vulture-stele be derived
        from the legend of Merodach or not, is doubtful—in all probability it

        years in erecting a tower, which was so high that the bird of
        imagination could not reach its summit. When it was completed, he
        ascended to the pinnacle of the spire, but the aspect of the heavens
        remained precisely the same as from the surface of the earth. This
        astonished and perplexed him. The next day the tower fell, and such a
        fearful noise struck the ears of the inhabitants of Babel that most
        of them fainted from the effects thereof; and when they had recovered
        their senses they forgot their own language, so that every tribe

        the second marriage could not have been due to the absence of

        taken on account of the ill-health of the first (Ḫammurabi's Code,

        Jacob's wrestling with <span class="tei tei-q">“a man”</span> (Gen.
        xxxii. 24 ff.) brings out the interesting name Peniel or Penuel (vv.
        30 and 31), explained as <span class="tei tei-q">“the face of
        God,”</span> so called because he had there <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“seen God face to face.”</span> A similar name to this is
        the Babylonian <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ana-pâni-îli</span></span>, <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“to the face of God,”</span> sometimes shortened to
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Appâni-îli</span></span>. The documents bearing
        the latter are of the time of Samsu-iluna, and are therefore rather
        earlier than the time of Jacob. Besides the meaning given above,
        other renderings are possible, and the question arises, whether
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ana-pâni-îli</span></span> means <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“(let me go) to the presence”</span> or <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“before the face of God,”</span> or that its bearer was
        asked for by his father <span class="tei tei-q">“at the presence of
        God.”</span> Many other possible renderings will also, in all
        probability, occur to the reader, but it is noteworthy, that in this
        case, the Biblical narrative may, by chance, serve to explain this
        Babylonian compound, for as <span class="tei tei-q">“the man”</span>
        with whom Jacob wrestled was the representative of the Almighty, so
        <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">pâni</span></span> in the Babylonian name may be
        interpreted in the same way, and the person bearing it may have been
        offered or dedicated to the face, or presence (that is, the
        representative) of God. It is to be noted that the owner of the name
        on Mr. Offord's cylinder (pl. vi. no. 2) was a worshipper of the god
        Hadad or Rimmon, and was not, therefore, a monotheist.</p>

        already settled many doubtful points concerning the topography of
        Babylon, and it is certain that, after the destruction of the city,
        exaggerated accounts of its enormous extent obtained credence.
        According to Delitzsch, it was not larger than Munich or Dresden,
        though even that is a good size for an Oriental city. The principal
        ruins are on the right bank of the river, and included Babil
        (<span class="tei tei-q">“Probably a palace”</span>), to protect
        which the city-wall makes a considerable angle on the north. From
        this point the wall continues its course in a south-easterly
        direction for a considerable distance, and turning at a right angle
        at its farthest point from the river, runs back in a south-westerly
        direction to meet it again. About a mile south of Babil the visitor
        comes upon the great ruin known as the Kasr, where stood
        Nebuchadnezzar's second palace. On the eastern side of this is the
        <span class="tei tei-q">“procession-street”</span> of the god
        Merodach, from which came some very fine reliefs of <span class=
        "tei tei-q">“the Lion of Babylon,”</span> beautifully wrought in
        coloured and enamelled brick. The temple of the goddess Nin-maḫ lay
        to the south-east of the southern end of the street, and between the
        two was situated the celebrated Gate of Ištar, adorned with lions and
        strangely-formed dragons, already referred to (p. <a href="#Pg551"
        class="tei tei-ref">551</a>). Proceeding to the south-west from the
        temple of Nin-maḫ, we reach Nebuchadnezzar's earlier palace, a very
        extensive structure, with a spacious court-yard and a large hall used
        as a throne-room, on the south side of which the recess for the
        throne is still visible. The palace of his father Nabopolassar, which
        adjoined it on the west, has not yet been excavated. About
        half-a-mile to the south of these palaces lie the ruins of the great
        temple of Belus, in the mound now known as Amran-ibn-Ali (see pp.
        <a href="#Pg137" class="tei tei-ref">137</a> ff., <a href="#Pg476"

        "tei tei-q">“shrine,”</span> but the rendering would not be
        materially changed thereby.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The remainder of
        the inscription, which is exceedingly interesting, is rather
        mutilated, and a trustworthy translation of it is at present
        exceedingly difficult. Certain thieves (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">šarraqa</span></span>), however, seem to be
        mentioned, and had to all appearance stripped (<span class=
        "tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">iqlubū</span></span>) the image of Uru-gala and
        another, <span class="tei tei-q">“a deity whose name was called
        Ammani'ita.”</span> On the 10th of Marcheswan these thieves were
        captured and imprisoned, and on the 13th to all appearance judged and
        condemned. <span class="tei tei-foreign"><span style=
        "font-style: italic">Ûmu šuati ina išati qalû</span></span>,
        <span class="tei tei-q">“That day they were burnt in the
        fire”</span>—such is the end of the story.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">This seems not to
        be in accordance with the laws of sacrilegious theft, as stated in
        sections 6 and 8 of Ḫammurabi's code. Perhaps the law had changed in
        the 1800 years which had elapsed since the time of that ruler; or
        stripping a sacred image was a much more heinous crime than mere
        theft from a temple, which, in the first degree, was punishable with
        death.</p>

        <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">It is noteworthy
        that refusal to worship the image set up by Nebuchadnezzar was
        visited, in Dan. iii, with the same penalty, probably as showing
        contempt for the divinity.</p>

          "font-style: italic">Records of the Past</span></span>, 2nd series,
          vol. ii. p. 43) are worth repeating. He points out that there were
          three Pharaohs named Soqnun-rî (= Seqnen-Rê), and he implies that
          it was in all probability the last of these which is referred to.
          He perished by a violent death, perhaps in battle against the
          Hyksos themselves. <span class="tei tei-q">“He had shaved his head
          the morning before, <span class="tei tei-q">‘arraying himself for
          the combat like the god Montu,’</span> as the Egyptian scribes
          would say. His courage led him to penetrate too far into the ranks
          of the enemy; he was surrounded and slain before his companions
          could rescue him. The blow of an axe removed part of his left cheek
          and laid bare the teeth, striking the jaw and felling him stunned
          to the ground; a second blow entered far within the skull, a dagger
          or short lance splitting the forehead on the right side a little
          above the eye. The Egyptians recovered the body and embalmed it in
          haste, when already partly decomposed, before sending it to Thebes
          and the tomb of his ancestors.... The author of the legend may
          probably have continued the story down to the tragic end of his
          hero. The scribe to whom we owe the papyrus on which it is
          inscribed must certainly have intended to complete the tale; he had
          recopied the last lines on the reverse of one of the pages, and was
          preparing to continue it when some accident intervened to prevent
          his doing so.... It is probable, however, that it went on to
          describe how Soqnun-rî, after long hesitation, succeeded in
          escaping from the embarrassing dilemma in which his powerful rival
          had attempted to place him. His answer must have been as odd and
          extraordinary as the message of 'Apôpi, but we have no means even
          of conjecturing what it was.”</span></dd>

              freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">Project
              Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
              public support and donations to carry out its mission of
              increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that
              can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible
              by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.
              Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important
              to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">The
              Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
              charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the
              United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it
              takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to
              meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit
              donations in locations where we have not received written
              confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the
              status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href=

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">While we
              cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
              have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no
              prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors
              in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>

              <p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
              International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot
              make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations
              received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp
              our small staff.</p>
